<h3 class="ai-optimize-18"><span style="color: #800000;">What is Credential Dumping?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-19"><span style="color: #000000;">When people in the cyber world use the term <strong data-start="128" data-end="149">password cracking</strong>, they use it as a broad concept that covers all methods related to attacking, dumping, or retrieving passwords of a victim or target. However, in this article, we will solely focus on a technique called <strong data-start="353" data-end="375">Credential</strong> Dumping.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-20"><span style="color: #000000;">Additionally, people describe <strong data-start="410" data-end="432">Credential Dumping</strong> as a technique for extracting usernames and passwords of any login account from the target system. This technique allows an attacker to get credentials of multiple accounts from one person. Moreover, these credentials can include anything, such as bank accounts, email accounts, social media accounts, or wireless networks.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-21"><span style="color: #800000;">Credential Dumping in Real Life</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-22"><span style="color: #000000;">When an attacker has access to the target system and through that access, they successfully retrieve the whole bunch of their credentials. Once you are inside the target’s system, there are multiple methods to retrieve the credentials of a particular thing. For instance, to redeem all the names and passwords of the wireless networks to which the operating system has connected, there are various methods that an attacker can use and we will try and cover all of those methods here in our article. Now another thing to focus on is that both internal penetration testing and external penetration testing can perform this dumping of credentials. The methodology, perspective, or subjectivity of the attack determines which method is the best suitable.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-23"><span style="color: #800000;">Credential Dumping Methods</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-24"><span style="color: #000000;">Just like the instance presented above, we will portray various methods to dump wireless credentials from a system in this article. So, let’s get started, shall we?</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-25"><span style="color: #000000;">Manual Credential Dumping </span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-26"><span style="color: #000000;">All the Wi-Fi password with their respective SSID are stored in an XML file. The location of these files is <strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Wlansvc\Profiles\Interfaces\***. </strong>Here, you will find that SSID of wifi is saved in clear text whereas passwords are stored as keys.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pRL_23vb51s/XoCRRewQGqI/AAAAAAAAjSk/qe2InWURF147OCok0E2BxSLcqi20xfF-gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/0.jpg"/></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-27"><span style="color: #000000;">Credential Dumping using netsh </span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-28"><span style="color: #000000;">Netsh is a scripting utility provided by Microsoft itself. You can use it both in command prompt or Windows PowerShell. Netsh is short for network shell. When you execute it, it provides detailed information about the configuration of the network that the system ever had; including revealing the credentials of wireless networks that it has ever been connected to. This utility comes with various parameters that you can use to get various information as per the requirement. You can use this method both in internal and external penetration testing as you can execute netsh commands both locally and remotely.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-29"><span style="color: #000000;">To get the list of the SSIDs that the device has been connected to use the following command:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">netsh wlan show profiles</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_8GXrsBhBk0/XoCRRpTnL9I/AAAAAAAAjSo/deaKLyGvVmASu-xmFXmsgDJm4et32mrQACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-30"><span style="color: #000000;">And as a result of the above command, you can see the names of the Wi-Fi networks that the system connected to in the past or present such as Meterpreter, Linuxlab, etc. The image above demonstrates the same.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-31"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, to know the passwords of any one of the mentioned SSIDs use the following command :</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">netsh wlan show profile name=&lt;SSID Name&gt; key=clear</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xZe8LSsxzOk/XoCRRtzZAfI/AAAAAAAAjSs/6uMWTHdEO780UArrbjko1GcWzTNPvAhkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-32"><span style="color: #000000;">And just like it is shown in the image above, the result of the above command will give you the password.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-33"><span style="color: #800000;">Credential Dumping using WirelessKeyView</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-34"><span style="color: #000000;">A wireless key view is a simple software accesses the XML files where wireless passwords are stored and reveals them in cleartext. This tool was developed to recover lost and forgotten password of a wireless network. This is the perfect method for credential dumping in internal network penetration testing. To utilize this method simply download the tool from<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wireless_key.html"> here</a> and run it, you will get all the Wi-Fi names and its password as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-35"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> <img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QKXUFIhThIc/XoCRSrQ84qI/AAAAAAAAjS0/kOzuiTtYZqw0CVGMKVb8WVv4s2m3dd7QACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/3.jpg"/></strong></span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-36"><span style="color: #800000;">Credential Dumping using Wifi Network Properties</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-37"><span style="color: #000000;">Our next method is manual, it is good when you are introduced to the network to work but for some reason, the password of the network isn’t revealed to you. Then you can use this method, as it falls under the category of internal penetration testing methodology. To reveal the password of a wireless network manually, go to <strong>Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center</strong> and then click on <strong>Wi-Fi (*SSID*)</strong>. A dialogue box will open, in that box click <strong>Wireless Properties</strong> button in the upper pane. Next, go to <strong>Security</strong> tab and you can see the password there just as it is shown in the image below:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6c7dEIamv5E/XoCRS74G9AI/AAAAAAAAjS4/mLAMgU6_sc4XDQx6SN-8UwhF8-xq0nHfACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/4.jpg"/></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-38"><span style="color: #800000;">Credential Dumping using LaZagne</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-39"><span style="color: #000000;">LaZagne is an open-source tool that developers created to retrieve all the passwords stored in your machine. We have covered LaZagne in our other article, which you can read from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.hackingarticles.in/post-exploitation-on-saved-password-with-lazagne/">here</a>. In our experience, LaZagne is an amazing tool for credential dumping and it is the best tool to use for external penetration testing. To extract Wi-Fi password with LaZagne, simply download the tool from here and run it remotely using it following command :</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">lazagne.exe wifi</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i_Png2DtyVo/XoCRUtOIpdI/AAAAAAAAjTA/KRBgTIw5X3M_lKp3DVtI1LBiFZDt4enNgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/5.png"/></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-40"><span style="color: #000000;">After running the above command, all the Wi-Fi-related passwords with their respective SSID will be extracted.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-41"><span style="color: #800000;">Credential Dumping using Mimikatz</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-42"><span style="color: #000000;">Another method that can be very useful in external penetration testing is using Mimikatz. We have covered various features of Mimikatz in our other article, which you can find <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.hackingarticles.in/understanding-guide-mimikatz/">here</a>. Once you have the victim’s session use the following commands to get the passwords:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">getsystem
load kiwi
wifi_list_shared</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U4F9K34Ns-Y/XoCRVExj0vI/AAAAAAAAjTI/0XA-bz8hkjEUzZVI1I1IY09v67G_v4a4gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/6.png"/></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-43"><span style="color: #000000;">And very easily you will have all the passwords at your service as shown in the image above.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-44"><span style="color: #800000;">Credential Dumping using Metasploit Framework</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-45"><span style="color: #000000;">Then our next method is to use Metasploit to retrieving desired passwords. As all of us know that Metasploit is a framework that provides us with already constructed exploits to make pentesting convenient. And is an amazing platform for a beginner and expert in hacking pentesting world.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-46"><span style="color: #000000;">Now, to dump credentials there comes an in-built post exploit in the Metasploit and to run the said exploit; go to the terminal of Metasploit by typing msfconsole and get the session of you to the target system using any exploit you prefer. And then background the session use the post-exploit for extracting desired Wi-Fi credentials by using the following commands:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">use post/windows/wlan/wlan_profile
set session 1
exploit</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZkvKyFvklLw/XoCRUqCLTZI/AAAAAAAAjTE/uWRQoq7gQRgKG-T67we_NLIB0edZ-_DKwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/7.png"/></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-47"><span style="color: #000000;">And just as it is shown in the image above, you will have your credentials.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-48"><span style="color: #800000;">Mitigation</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-49"><span style="color: #000000;">There are various measures that you can follow in order to protect yourself from credential dumping attacks. These measures are given below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-50"><span style="color: #000000;">Keep you employees/employers aware</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-51"><span style="color: #000000;">DO NOT use default SSID of a wireless network</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-52"><span style="color: #000000;">Do not save the passwords on the system</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-53"><span style="color: #000000;">Always reconnect to a Wi-Fi manually.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-54"><span style="color: #000000;">Have a different network for guests</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-55"><span style="color: #000000;">Use VPN</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-56"><span style="color: #000000;">Change your Wi-Fi password regularly</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-57"><span style="color: #000000;">Use a different IP address instead of the default one</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-58"><span style="color: #000000;">Make sure your modems don’t have reset button as most of the modems come with the reset button. When the said button is pressed, it brings back the default settings which doesn’t have any security layer and allows anyone to connect.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-59"><span style="color: #000000;">So, these were the methods to dump wireless credentials. Apply the suggested mitigation to your systems or networks in order to keep yourself safe from attackers. I hope these were useful and keep tuning in for various hacking techniques!</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-60"><span style="color: #000000;">We are well aware these are tough times for everyone and, we, here at hacking articles hope and pray that everyone is safe and following the measure of self-quarantine. And for all the hacking/pen-testing enthusiasts we are working hard to bring more and more new content so that you can learn new things and use this self-isolation to its best. Stay Safe and take care! Happy Hacking!</span></p>
