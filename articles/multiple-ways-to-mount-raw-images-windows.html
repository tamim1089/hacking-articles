<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Introduction</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the Cyber Forensic world, a forensic image is a complete sector by sector copy of a hard drive or external drive. Generally, a forensic image is used as evidence in forensic investigation. These images include unlocated space, slack space and boot records. Some computer forensic tool uses different formats to generate a forensic image.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some common forensic images formats are RAW, E01, AFF, etc. We can use a variety of tools to analyze and mount that image to get better investigative results.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Why Mount an Image?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mounting is the process that converts a RAW logical image into a mounted directory. To better examine a forensic image mounting is preferred. There are various tools that can be used to mount a RAW image. Let’s Learn the process of mounting using this variety of tools. Although the basic procedure is the same there are times where an investigator finds himself in a situation where he/she cannot use their preferred tool. Also, Each investigative company uses different tools. So a good investigator should know all the different types of tools to widen their ability and robustness.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Tool #1: Mount Image Pro</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mount Image Pro is a tool, which is quite useful in Forensic investigations. It enables the mounting image across all the forensic image extensions. Some of them are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">.RAW</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">.E01 (Encase Image)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">.A01</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">.dd</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">GetData developed this tool. They are a renowned provider of user-end software that provides data recovery, file recovery, computer forensics, and file previewing. Their products are designed to get data back from systems and their hard drives.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Downloading and Launching Mount Image Pro</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We can download the mount image pro from <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.mountimage.com/">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once downloaded the mount image pro, then launch tool using the Icon created on the Desktop. After launching the app, we need to press the <strong>Mount</strong> icon to get started.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z7IiEUlXsHs/XihqciOCbQI/AAAAAAAAiSI/cr1EUH8t6Mg5CTIhIFIQE00jLI1Nbtv8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We can also click on the File from the Dropdown menu. Go for the “<strong>Mount Image File</strong>” Option to move ahead.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z7IiEUlXsHs/XihqciOCbQI/AAAAAAAAiSI/cr1EUH8t6Mg5CTIhIFIQE00jLI1Nbtv8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After this, we need to select our digital image file on our hard drive. Subsequently, after selecting the image file, we need to click on the <strong>“Open”</strong> button in order to open the image file..</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XJ12SjPSKKg/XihqgxYEpgI/AAAAAAAAiS8/Ok5usT_2h2Y3Y8WRhGhb1-LOzM0Qy6a-ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/3.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then, we need to select a bunch of options to get started. First one is How we want to mount our image? We want the image to be mounted and shown as a partition in our Explorer. Hence we choose the Disk Option. If you want to investigate the image as a Directory choose File System. Followed by this is the location where we want to mount. If we choose the File System Option, we need to specify the Destination Directory. Here we can Choose an Alphabet which would act as Drive Letter (such as Local Disk D: or E: etc.). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Next, we get to Disk options panel here, we checked plug and play so that the dismount is easier. Now we select the kind of access that we want to get. We choose the Read-Only Access. We can also customize the Sector Size of the Partition. After giving all the required details press the <strong>OK</strong> button.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yNmyyP-itD8/XihqhVHCeWI/AAAAAAAAiTA/3S-KwmFKSZchB8FbZvDIye0AUx4bYrr6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/4.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After this, mounting will starts and we get a live progression of the process through the status bar as depicted below.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-50TivcHEeIs/XihqhxqXFeI/AAAAAAAAiTE/BaKhcyWrossaEJzpTA93LCaS_rBgpifxwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/5.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then, we will get our mounted image and we can start our investigation.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7q6p4TWqfi8/XihqiLWlcFI/AAAAAAAAiTI/s5_Zg-FxdCMMUfVYCCmnPpqId57DyUlewCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/6.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As the screenshot suggests it mounted our forensic image as F drive. Then, we can analyze it and get the same view from the files as its user gets in its system.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Tool #2: OSF Mount</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OSF Mount is the software that allows us to mount local disk image files (sector by sector copies off an entire disk or disk partition) in windows system.  We can then analyze the disk with its other tool which is OS Forensics. By default, the image files are mounted as read-only so that our original image files do not get altered.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This software supports mounting disk images files in any mode, whether we want them in the read-only mode, write mode in write cache mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We can download OSF mount from <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html">here</a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Let’s Begin with opening the OSF mount after completing its installation process. The developers at PassMark gave us a neat UI to work upon. We have a very minimalistic interface here. To begin with, we will hit the <strong>“Mount New</strong>” Button.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U5ChZoBvTm0/XihqiQGtsNI/AAAAAAAAiTM/-1I1SS2rjvEd-EolwmIb0IQXh1JshMnmACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/7.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After that, we follow a series of steps where we fill in the required details.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Step #1: We need to provide the source of the image file to mount for our investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After filling in details, we hit the <strong>Next</strong> button.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-92lTsbuNEp4/Xihqiz8pBWI/AAAAAAAAiTQ/z0nWrFN6v1obM3RRPgLHPm7XMwY5VaDkgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/8.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Step #2: We need to select if we want a specific partition or we want the entire image mounted for investigation.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mysuL2Uwq14/Xihqi98qYAI/AAAAAAAAiTU/dQUde4dfp48Vz48mE9M4nfOQcsBLcUr1wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/9.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After that step, we need to finalize things. In the last step, we need to select a few details regarding our image. These are some additional features that we want to include in our process or not. These features include if we want to mount our image as a removable media or not, the Drive type, the Drive letter, Drive emulations, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After filling all details and completing all steps click on the mount button to start mounting the image file.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ypNZPetCtxA/Xihqcj5sVTI/AAAAAAAAiSM/2x94yuECVJ0kaxf6BvP1ide9ugO8RVHLACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/10.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now as shown in the image given below we have the image successfully mounted and ready for the analysis.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lNpvQZ1VrMw/XihqcVpGM8I/AAAAAAAAiSE/doAiXj8rJAITbskafeqSjL0FMFnuEvl4QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/11.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We can also check the working of the mounted image file by opening the mounted image in the File Explorer as shown in the image given below:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zou3CB5eFWo/Xihqdb9Ov0I/AAAAAAAAiSQ/hnHz5N1g5F8HEta0QqLnI_NlR1GfCUDQgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/12.png"/></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Tool #3: Arsenal Image Mounter</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal image mounter handles the disk images as a whole drive. As far as Windows system is concerned, the contents of disk images mounted by AIM are real SCSI disk, which allows its users to take advantage from some disk specific features like Integration with Disk Manager and Access to volume shadow copies and much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Many of the image mounting solutions in the market contents of disk images as share and partition rather than complete disk. Which some times limits their usefulness to digital forensics practitioners or investigators. If AIM is running without a license, it will run in free mode and provide core functionalities. If it is licensed, it will run in professional mode with full functionalities enabled.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We can download our Arsenal Image Mounter from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://arsenalrecon.com/products/">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After downloading and completing its installation process, We can open this software and start mounting an image file. After opening that software click on the <strong>“Mount disk image”</strong> button.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fU4cZ46noUg/XihqdbL1xcI/AAAAAAAAiSU/w7qNW1RQSvA-p2eil3DeqlQAsHmWPtBSQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/13.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now we need to fill in some details. We are asked about the mode in which we want to see our mounted image and what type of device it must be. We can select Read Only or Writeable, among other choices. For a smoother mounting operation, we must additionally enter the Sector Size and select the Create “removable” disk device option. After filling out all of the details, click the OK button to proceed.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fthZ_J6mJJ4/Xihqd_qWtaI/AAAAAAAAiSY/ud4USOPJJa4DHUmGojR1oZh98wNIrHAhACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/14.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After this our disk is mounted successfully, we will get all the details regarding that with that mounted message.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-febtzHng0KE/XihqeJ6GjHI/AAAAAAAAiSc/xFRhOlc-2Cob1ckvjuM0RbXyklI7Oqp9QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/15.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now we check if our image is successfully mounted as a removable device in our system. After checking that, now we can finally start our investigation process.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu-uo0slb6Y/XihqeVRCbbI/AAAAAAAAiSg/ZHWrUv2Sf4k0JISxUu1RU0w1D1gGK9K2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/16.png"/></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Tool #4: Access Data FTK Imager</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Access Data believes that zero is on the relevant evidence quickly, conduct faster searches and dramatically increase analysis speed with FTK. FTK uses distributed processing and it is a solution to fully leverage multi-core and multi-thread computers. While other tools waste the usage of modern hardware solutions. Where FTK try to use 100 per cent of its hardware resources for trying to help in the investigation process.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">FTK provides faster searching in comparison to other solutions. FTK is truly database-driven; we store all data securely and centrally, which allows our teams to use the same database and reduces costs by creating multiple data sets.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We can download our access data FTK Imager from <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.exterro.com/digital-forensics-software/ftk-imager">here</a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After finishing up the installation process, Open the software to move further ahead.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MpmZwDwFZdU/XihqeibtE3I/AAAAAAAAiSk/O9ds1R0eU9c4fIMuqmFOznls6HIz0sitwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/17.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now, click on the File option from Menu and Select the “<strong>Image Mounting</strong>” option to start the image mounting process.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1ypcV2d8k0g/XihqfMrRSMI/AAAAAAAAiSo/lCd_81_vt7IAe3pwPMx-9InxHwjtA07ogCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/18.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now we explore the Add Image file option. We browse the image file in the system, then fill up the details like image file mount type, its drive letter, and its mount method.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After filling up all mandatory details regarding the process, click on the <strong>Mount</strong> button to start the mounting process.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MKiUHIiWQkA/Xihqfev0itI/AAAAAAAAiSs/b3OZEDvAkHIkd-IU4Fif1CLanU6ob7_bQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/19.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It takes some time to mount an image, but after finishing up the process we will get the details of our mounted image which comes in the mapped images section. It provides us with some basic information regarding Drive, Method, Partition, Image locations, etc.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MavVloQaK30/XihqgUGd3EI/AAAAAAAAiS0/4kzQz6jQuPc_1bAqRdH27HkkmyLoUsroQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/20.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If we want we check the integrity information we can do so by checking or monitoring this drive physically by reaching this drive location to validate that data information and start our investigation.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4tU9aEXMcQ4/Xihqg9zO9pI/AAAAAAAAiS4/_7cbuNtMO7ADSLmp5y16JxQDmoTt-B47wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/21.png"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">These are different ways in which we can mount a forensic image window to help investigators. For a better analysis of the evidence, it will help them in their investigation process.</span></p>
