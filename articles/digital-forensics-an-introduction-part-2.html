<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Understanding the difference between E-Discovery &amp; Digital Forensics</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Internet community is many times confused between these two terms. Here a few points that highlight the importance and usage of E-discovery and Digital Forensics.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #800000;">E-Discovery</span> </span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">E-Discovery stands for Electronic Discovery. We define it as the process of collecting, preparing, reviewing, interpreting, and presenting electronic documents from hard disks and other forms of storage devices in civil litigations. The following are the key points to remember in E-discovery.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Digital Forensics</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Digital Forensics can be defined as the process of preservation, identification, extraction, and documentation of digital evidence which is used by the court of law to facilitate criminal investigations.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M8YfY6b3ZTE/X2yIeHDGq4I/AAAAAAAAo2M/zugbXMRqSwcaEvJwXfIktAKnAgMbPycewCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/2.png" alt="Introduction to Digital Forensics" width="1051" height="549"/></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Methodology for Digital Investigators</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A Digital Forensic Investigator has a huge responsibility on his shoulders when he is investigating a case as his findings will bring justice to the innocent and punish the criminal. Therefore, there a set of steps that he should follow when he is investigating a case. The following are a generalized step of the investigation, whereas the Investigator can follow the steps prescribed by their Institution or the framework they follow.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>STEP 01</strong>: <strong>Prepare a preliminary design or a method to approach the case</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The investigator should prepare a method on how he will go about with the investigation and have a clear understanding of the crime scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He should make sure that at a scene where the computer or a device is in a power-on state. He should not make the mistake of turning it off, or running any program or perform any other activity.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>STEP 02</strong>: <strong>Determine the resources that are required for the case </strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The investigator has to understand the requirements of tools and technologies that are required for the case to be investigated further. He should be qualified enough and should make sure that he prevents data from being over-written.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>STEP 03</strong>: <strong>Discover and obtain the evidence</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The investigator has to make sure that he does not miss out on any evidence at the scene of the crime and obtains them within the most accurate way, which does not cause any damage to the evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Investigator should make sure to collect the evidence sample in a Faraday Bag or an anti-static bag so that the evidence cannot be tampered with.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He should make sure at every moment to maintain the chain of custody.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iruBmHynwd4/X2yIiidNkfI/AAAAAAAAo2Q/oXAaPo-u43Yi5ityKiCUXLQl1xWPpxJjgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/3.png"/></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>STEP 04</strong>: <strong>Make multiple Forensic</strong> <strong>copies of the evidence </strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In Digital Forensic Investigation, it is very essential to remember that as long as possible, one should never work on the original evidence item. The investigator should make sure to create multiple copies of the same and perform analysis on the copy of the original evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Before he creates a copy of the evidence, he should always calculate the hash value of the evidence that as recovered in the original form to maintain the authenticity of the evidence.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>STEP 05</strong>: <strong>Identify and minimize the risks involved</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The investigator should remember that analyzing the collected evidence is not always easy. A huge amount of risks and consequences are involved. He should be qualified enough to estimate the amount of risk and possible damage. He should try to come up with better alternatives to minimize the risk.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>STEP 06</strong>: <strong>Analyse and Recover the evidence</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once the investigator has the evidence, he can now start analyzing the copy of the original evidence by using various commercial and open-source software that is suitable for that case. He can also use various software to recover the evidence that has been deleted.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>STEP 07: Create a detailed case report about the investigation</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once the investigator has completed the analysis of the evidence and has found important artifacts on recovering data. He can then create a detailed report about his findings, methodologies, and tools used by him in the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If the jury or the court so demands, the investigator must appear in court as an expert witness. And explain the matter in plainer language so that those without a technical background may better comprehend it..</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Evidence Collection Methods</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The inter-related methods of collecting evidence terms almost serve the same purpose; the only important thing for an investigator to remember is that they must ensure the copy is forensically sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Image Copy: </strong>It refers to be the duplicate of the original disk.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bit-Stream Image: </strong>It is a clone copy of the original evidence. It includes files from sectors, clusters, and retrieves deleted files of a disk.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bit-Stream Copy:</strong> You can define a bit-stream copy as a bit-by-bit copy of the original evidence or storage medium, which can be its exact copy. You can also call a bit-stream copy a Forensic Copy of the disk.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Mirror Copy: </strong>A mirror copy is the precise replica (backup) of the disk.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5MkQIZhqmS8/X2yIoOHvgdI/AAAAAAAAo2U/oMq5J-tQ07szdyoKQvwni88fJP5VsYMxACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/4.png" alt="Introduction to Digital Forensics" width="493" height="523"/></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Disk Imaging and Cloning</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Disk Imaging</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is the process of making an archival or backup copy of the entire hard drive. It is a storage file that contains all the necessary information to boot to the operating system. However, you need to apply this imaged disk to the hard drive to work. You cannot restore a hard drive by placing the disk image files on it as you need to open and install it on the drive using an imaging program. A single hard drive can store many disk images on it. Disk images can also be stored on flash drives with a larger capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Disk Cloning</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is the process of copying the entire contents of a hard drive to another including all the information that can boot to the operating system from the drive. It allows you to create a one-to-one copy of one of your hard drive on another hard drive. You can completely swap the other copy of the hard drive with the computer’s existing hard drive. If you boot the cloned drive, it will have data identical to the source drive at the time you created it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Below is a simple difference between Disk Imaging and Cloning.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-atl6MX639OY/X2yItch-zqI/AAAAAAAAo2Y/8I0Ca_FPEv04F55KYMH_VQsSp_d_z93ewCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/5.png"/></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Challenges faced by Digital Forensic Investigator</span></h3>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Legal Issues</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The most important issue an investigator may encounter is ensuring the court accepts the guarantee of evidence admissibility.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Nature of Digital Evidence</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The advancement in technology has impacted the investigation in such a way that it detecting the digital evidence has become extremely difficult. For example, cloud storage, PDAs, IoT devices, etc.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Alteration of Evidence</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Maintain the chain of custody at all times to keep the evidence’s credibility intact. If someone has the evidence in the wrong hands, they might alter it and may cause it to lose its credibility. Therefore, having a Forensic image and the hash value of the evidence is extremely important for the investigator.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Size and Distribution of the evidence</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The size and the distribution of the evidence matter because the data is no smaller. There is a huge amount of data produced regularly. In cases of Big data Forensic Investigation, the size and the widely distributed data comes up as a challenge for the investigator as he does not know where to start.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Malware Present in evidence</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The criminals can outsmart the investigators and insert malware in the evidence device which can mislead or disrupt the ongoing investigation.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Steganography</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In earlier times, steganography had only limited types but today, due to the availability of various tools and software on the dark web. It has become extremely difficult to detect steganography present in the evidence items. Sometimes the investigator doesn’t consider it as evidence as they aren’t able to get many in-depth ideas about the evidence.</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Encryption</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Many a time, investigators recover evidence in an encrypted form and have a hard time decrypting it with no assurance of recovery of the original contents. </span></p>
