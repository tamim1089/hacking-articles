<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 0</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is a pretty simple level. It teaches us to connect to a host using SSH. This is going to teach players the usage of SSH command.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We got the required information from reading the instruction page.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Host:</strong> bandit.labs.overthewire.org</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Port:</strong> 2220</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Username:</strong> bandit0</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Password:</strong> bandit0</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We used the above information to </span>login<span style="color: #000000;"> using ssh as shown in the given image.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This level doesn’t require anything else other than logging in. Time to move in on the next level.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 0-1</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now, from the bandit0 shell, we need to find the password for logging as the next user. To find that password, we are going to list files in the directory. Our target is to find a file named readme. After finding that file, we need to read the password stored inside that file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We use the ls command to list the files in the current directory. We found the readme file. Now to read the password we will use the cat command. After that, we are going to use the password to login into next level using SSH</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls -la
cat readme
ssh bandit1@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HAPgapWAHdc/XHzZL--g2MI/AAAAAAAAdPs/nqI_cmTsv74CBBMPaP-VPeqhH8Xz2Xt3ACLcBGAs/s1600/1.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 1-2</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a file named -(hyphen). So, to find it we use the ls command. Now comes the part where we have to read the file. As the file is named -(hyphen) we won’t be able to read it simply by cat command. As cat command considers -(hyphen) as stdin/Stout. If we directly use cat command, it won’t be able to understand that hyphen is a file name. So, we will prefix the command with the path ./, This will help us to read the password stored as shown in the given figure. Since we found the password for the user bandit2. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit2.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">ls
cat ./-
ssh bandit2@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><img decoding="async" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WffCRGylJCw/XHzZPKHSRfI/AAAAAAAAdQg/dVXbQXP_gd8wMM2_CTbCahzKJmmtN6YuQCLcBGAs/s1600/3.png"/></strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 2-3</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a file named spaces in this filename. So, to find it we use the ls command. Now comes the part where we have to read the file. As the file is named spaces in this filename, we won’t be able to read it simply by cat command. As cat command reads files name only until space as it considers space as null ‘/0’. If we directly use cat command, it won’t be able to find the file. So, we will write the name of the file in quotes, this will help us to read the password stored as shown in the given figure. Since we found the password for the user bandit3. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit3.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls
cat 'spaces in this filename'
ssh bandit3@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FJzGJoM2xac/XHzZPezJ_qI/AAAAAAAAdQk/1d1YZGGYnwct5xjPOwKgWRq5d7S-3AdvQCLcBGAs/s1600/4.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 3-4</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a directory named inhere. So, to find it we use the ls command. Now, after traversing inside inhere directory we run ls command again.  Now it might be the case that the file is hidden. So, we run ls command with -al parameter. It lists all files including the hidden one. And we found the .hidden file. In Linux, the file with a dot(.) in front of the name of the file makes it hidden. Now we would simply use the cat command to read the password stored in the file. Since we found the password for the user bandit4. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit4.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls
cd inhere/
ls
ls -al
cat .hidden
ssh bandit4@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_ZXIyRtpgcs/XHzZP3HExsI/AAAAAAAAdQo/3-8fEv4AJE4Jyl-B3XfZTA7H4lt0RJEdACLcBGAs/s1600/5.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 4-5</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a human-readable file. So, to find it we use the ls command. Now, after traversing inside inhere directory we run ls command again. This gives us a bunch of files as shown in the image. We will use the file command to get the information about the files. From files command, we now know that the file07 contains ASCII text. It is mostly readable text. So, let’s read it using cat command. This gives us the password for the next level. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit5.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls -la
cd inhere/
ls
file ./*
cat ./-file07
ssh bandit5@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-keYMagDYB5A/XHzZQCTpTbI/AAAAAAAAdQs/4K8bbNhkw2opnWS-7B3WvVSHtqi6IQbDACLcBGAs/s1600/6.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 5-6</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a directory named inhere. So, to find it we use the ls command. Now, after traversing inside inhere directory we run ls command again. This gives us a bunch of files as shown in the image. We will use the file size to find the file. Find command has the parameter of size in which we have to use ‘c’ for depicting size in bytes. From find command, we now know that the file2 contains the password. So, let’s read it using cat command. This gives us the password for the next level. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit6.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls
cd inhere/
ls
find . -size 1033c
cat ./maybehere07/.file2
ssh bandit6@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DCVo-EptUEE/XHzZQBNYvVI/AAAAAAAAdQw/_tp_50v7330kTGhkedWS8j4mjnIGAT8AACLcBGAs/s1600/7.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 6-7</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server. So, finding the file over the server would be a lot trickier if we are using ls. So, we will try to widen our scope of search using the find command. We are hinted that the user of the file is bandit7 and it is a part of group bandit 6. We will add this information as parameters in the find command. We are given the size too. Let’s add that too. Now as we can see in the given image, we successfully located the password file hidden over the server.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--h_1o9oTVDg/XHzZQbAYmqI/AAAAAAAAdQ0/59uJfly7Bs4afoD9QEFdx358RCbN-If3ACLcBGAs/s1600/8.png"/></span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
ssh bandit7@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From find command, we now know that the bandit7</span>.password<span style="color: #000000;"> contains the credentials. So, let’s read it using cat command. This gives us the password for the next level. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit7.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M9zb1YAjAOY/XHzZQvL_poI/AAAAAAAAdQ4/C7riy1aaZjErlZhyYTBcGb4K5Hx6Vk29QCLcBGAs/s1600/9.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 7-8</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a file named data.txt. So, to find it we use the ls command. Now we are hinted that the password is written next to the word millionth in the data.txt file. This means if we find the millionth word, we find the password. We are going to use the grep command for finding millionth. Here we using the (|) Unix pipe. The Pipe connects the standard output from the first command and feeds it as standard input to the second command. In our case, first cat command reads the file and then the data inside the file is sent to grep command to work on. This gives us the password for the next level. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit8.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls
cat data.txt | grep millionth
ssh bandit8@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C60ms6NFeBg/XHzZMFazbCI/AAAAAAAAdP0/b7iriX251Og7VIyNoT4EHe607QNTEpNLwCLcBGAs/s1600/10.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 8-9</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a file named data.txt. It is hinted that the password is the only line of text that occurs only once. Here we are going to use sort command to sort the text inside the data.txt file. But still, the file contains a lot of repeating statements so we will use the </span>uniq<span style="color: #000000;"> command to print the not repeating statement. We are using multiple pipes here to get a filtered result. This gives us the password for the next level. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit9.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u
ssh bandit9@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bXXJQV7R7NU/XHzZLyVUu1I/AAAAAAAAdPw/hFnMnxWprjY5Ab8ThcQF66PgvBJ3ypR2QCLcBGAs/s1600/11.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 9-10</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a file named data.txt. We are hinted that the password is followed by several ‘=’ characters. Now if we are to use the cat command our screen would be filled with unreadable mesh. So, to get a more refined approach we are going to use strings command which prints character sequences that are at least 4 characters long. And to get to the exact location of the password, we are going to use grep. This gives us the password for the next level. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit10.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls
strings data.txt | grep =
ssh bandit10@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--DioeDrLUas/XHzZMyEfVkI/AAAAAAAAdP4/f_RS98kneaclBgUHpaV73Huo6a4CA5OfQCLcBGAs/s1600/12.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 10-11</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a file named data.txt. So, to find it we use the ls command. Now, we are hinted that the password is encrypted in Base64. Now we can either read the file with cat command and decode the Base64 manually but we have a command in Linux that can do the heavy lifting for us. So, we use piping to use cat command and base64 command with d parameter to read and decode the text simultaneously.  This gives us the password for the next level. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit11.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls
cat data.txt | base64 --decode
ssh bandit11@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xXBHYH4QyrU/XHzZM_qt-QI/AAAAAAAAdP8/BZZdcmMUmAc8AyiX4iS1emMBiYGsVNgsQCLcBGAs/s1600/13.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 11-12</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a file named data.txt. So, to find it we use the ls command. Now, we are hinted that the file containing the password has changed the format of letters in such a way that all the lowercase and uppercase letters have been rotated by 13 positions. If we can remember right that exactly what happens in ROT13 encryption. Now, to convert the text, we can use the ‘tr’ command. This command translates characters depending on the parameters provided. We used n-z and a-m because tr won’t continue to translate after the Z. This gives us the password for the next level. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit12.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls
cat data.txt | tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M
ssh bandit12@localhost</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo7jE1IU8pk/XHzZNGta2BI/AAAAAAAAdQA/Mv1MA-14sTsssxFensajxdVKUIRUqVoQwCLcBGAs/s1600/14.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 12-13</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that the password for the next level is stored inside a directory named </span>inhere<span style="color: #000000;">. So, to find it we use the ls command. We are hinted that the file containing the password is in the form of a hex dump. Just out of curiosity, let’s read the file using the cat command. As we can see in the given image that the password is not at all readable. We are also told that the password file has been repeatedly compressed. Now to decompress we are going to need a directory with </span>read<span style="color: #000000;"> and write permissions. The tmp directory in root contains the required permissions.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls
cat data.txt</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yTh-wYBayMo/XHzZNXfpiYI/AAAAAAAAdQE/4yVHk9dbWWsWkh_QP2J75ZTk8teaHygZACLcBGAs/s1600/15.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So, let’s create a directory inside the tmp directory. Here we named it pavan. Now for further operations let’s copy the file in the directory we just created. Now let’s traverse to our directory using the cd command. Now we check if we have our file in this directory. Now to understand the type of file we are going to use the file command it returns us the type of file.  On running the command, we are informed that the file is ASCII text. But as we saw earlier that it is not readable. The </span>xxd<span style="color: #000000;"> command is used in Linux to make the </span>hexdump<span style="color: #000000;"> of a file. It is also used to reverse this process. Let’s use it to retrieve the original file. We are going to use the ‘r’ parameter to revert the process and provide it with a filename where it should store its output. Here we will name it data1</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now it’s time to check the retrieved file, we use the file command again. This tells us that it is a gzip compressed file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now decompress first, we need to rename the file and provide it with a proper gzip extension. We are going to use the move command for this. We renamed the file as data2.gz. Now using the gzip command and -d parameter, we decompress the file.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">mkdir /tmp/pavan
cp data.txt /tmp/pavan
cd /tmp/pavan
ls
file data.txt
xxd -r data.txt data1
file data1
mv data1 data2.gz
gzip -d data2.gz</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3vqKWva7BXU/XHzZNluzQOI/AAAAAAAAdQI/b7r0Y7P1gngyCvxDr_t4RMzHny9Fmwb0gCLcBGAs/s1600/16.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now it’s time to check the retrieved file, we use the file command again. This tells us that it is a bzip2 compressed file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now to decompress first, we need to rename the file and provide it with a proper bzip2 extension. We are going to use the move command for this. We renamed the file as data3.bz2. Now using the bzip2 command and -d parameter, we decompress the file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now it’s time to check the retrieved file, we use the file command again. This tells us that it is a gzip compressed file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now decompress first, we need to rename the file and provide it with a proper gzip extension. We are going to use the move command for this. We renamed the file as data4.gz. Now using the gzip command and -d parameter, we decompress the file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now it’s time to check the retrieved file, we use the file command again. This tells us that it is a tar archive file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now to extract we will use the tar command with xvf parameters. This gives us a file named data5.bin</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">file data2
mv data2 data3.bz2
bzip2 -d data3.bz2
file data3
mv data3 data4.gz
gzip -d data4.gz
file data4
tar -xvf data4</pre>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now it’s time to check the retrieved file, we use the file command again. This tells us that it is a tar archive file. Now to extract we will use the tar command with xvf parameters. This gives us a file named data6.bin</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now it’s time to check the retrieved file, we use the file command again. This tells us that it is a bzip2 compressed file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now decompress first, we need to rename the file and provide it with a proper bzip2 extension. We are going to use the move command for this. We renamed the file as data7.bz2. Now using the bzip2 command and -d parameter, we decompress the file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now it’s time to check the retrieved file, we use the file command again. This tells us that it is a tar archive file. Now to extract we will use the tar command with xvf parameters. This gives us a file named data8.bin</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">file data5.bin
tar -xvf data5.bin
file data6.bin
mv data6.bin data7.bz2
bzip2 -d data7.bz2
file data7
tar -xvf data7</pre>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now it’s time to check the retrieved file, we use the file command again. This tells us that it is a gzip compressed file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now decompress first, we need to rename the file and provide it with a proper gzip extension. We are going to use the move command for this. We renamed the file as data9.gz. Now using the gzip command and -d parameter, we decompress the file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now to understand the type of file we are going to use the file command it returns us the type of file.  On running the command, we are informed that the file is ASCII text. This might be a readable file. We use the cat command to read the file. This gives us the password for the next level. We will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit13.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">file data8.bin
mv data8.bin data9.gz
gzip -d data9.gz
file data9
cat data9
ssh bandit13@localhost</pre>

<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Level 13-14</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are informed that we are not going to get a password for the next level. Instead, we are given an ssh private key. So, to get to the next level we are going to use that ssh private key. Firstly, let’s find that private key using the ls command. We found the private key. Now we will use it to get an SSH connection as bandit14.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">ls
ssh bandit14@localhost -i sshkey.private</pre>
