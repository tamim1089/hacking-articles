                <h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is a second article in the series “Firefox for Pentester”. Previously we talked about how we can enhance the Privacy and Protection in Firefox using various add-ons and so, in this article we will become competent to protect ourselves online through the configuration options that Firefox provides us. In comparison to other browsers, Firefox protects our data and information the most. And we all know that Mozilla Firefox is plausibly the best browser available today. It provides privacy features, active development, amazing security, and the cherry on top is it has frequent updates.  But we can still make it much more secure by modifying a few options.</span></p>

</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Configuration Settings</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When playing with the configurations in Firefox, numerous elements should be examined. Every option should be understood well enough for the changes to be made as they will change the way you browse your internet. To make changes in configurations of Firefox, type “<strong>about:config”</strong> in the URL bar as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HtRBiFu2QRc/X3zCNZlrVpI/AAAAAAAApOQ/_SjU-VImFeILiTmCHgHL5Qim2_b9ulQmQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/1.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once the <strong>about:config </strong>page loads, it will show you a warning. The warning will state that from here on if you change anything then it will void your warranty and whatever changes you make will be at your own risk. To move forward from here left click on the “<strong>I accept the risk!</strong>” as shown in the image above. Once you click on the button, you will meet with the page shown in the image below. Here are all the options regarding online privacy and protection present.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QN4I-t-p2aI/X3zCUksyk6I/AAAAAAAApOU/0yTf0knHG3oKbMbTd_a3Wj3gACPgwzWwwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/2.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Isolating first-party Domains</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Through the first option, we will modify is <strong>“privacy.firstparty.isolate”</strong>. This built-in characteristic allows you to only access first-party domains. That means all the third-party domains that tag along the first-party domains are now blocked and cannot track your activity online or collect your data. All this is possible as it isolates the first-party domains from others and stores your data separately so that cross-origin tracking is nullified. Hence, third-party cookies, hidden cookies, data sharing, and other options will be disabled.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value false i.e. it is disabled by default as messes up the authentication system of many websites. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to true. Setting the value from false to true will mean that you have now enabled this option. Once the option is enabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">privacy.firstpart.isolate</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> <img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ET8-Upuq3p0/X3zCbQkrsdI/AAAAAAAApOY/a2znoJ4YUhY3IdxbW5sQdhP7sQDYsqqeQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/3.png"/></strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Preventing browser fingerprinting</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The next option is “<strong>privacy.resistFingerprinting”</strong>. To understand what this option does, let us first understand what is browser fingerprinting. Client-side scripting that allows the website to load in the browser permits browser fingerprinting. Through this, they collect the information about the browser, operating system, cache-control header, all kinds of headers, list of fonts, plugins that are being used, microphone, camera, etc. Hence, they are called cookie-less monsters. This process of browser foot-printing starts the moment a connection is made with the website. And these features are exploited through credential hijacking, data breaching, etc. All of this can be stopped by enabling the “<strong>privacy.resistFingerprinting” </strong>option in your browser.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value false i.e. it is disabled by default as messes up the authentication system of many websites. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to true. Setting the value from false to true will mean that you have now enabled this option. Once the option is enabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">privacy.resistFingerprinting</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> <img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KZ44onDO9AI/X3zCj1q2OUI/AAAAAAAApOg/t42CqR0cAo40670i0gdHebBTBcsUMS7KACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/4.png"/></strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Enabling Tracking Protection (Browser Fingerprinting)</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The next option that we are going to talk about is <strong>privacy.trackingprotection.fingerprinting.enabled</strong> . It works the same as the previous one. As this one too protects you from browser fingerprinting. Along with preventing tracking over the websites, it also prevents phishing attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value false i.e. it is disabled by default as messes up the authentication system of many websites. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to true. Setting the value from false to true will mean that you have now enabled this option. Once the option is enabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">privacy.trackingprotection.fingerprinting.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> <img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pG8UwXpUnlM/X3zCp-jXmWI/AAAAAAAApOo/f4UNCXdgfwM6_BKdwEW26yG3v_3l76DxwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/5.png"/></strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Enabling Tracking Protection (Crypto Mining)</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The problem with crypto miners is that the calculations they do, require huge resources such as CPU, power, and RAM. These resources are expensive and not everyone can afford it. So, what hackers do is that they control systems of various people and carry out the deed of crypto mining from there system. So to stop your browser to fall victim to cryptomining all you have to do it enable the <strong>privacy.trackingprotection.cryptomining.enabled</strong> option.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value false i.e. it is disabled by default as messes up the authentication system of many websites. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to true. Setting the value from false to true will mean that you have now enabled this option. Once the option is enabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">privacy.trackingprotection.cryptomining.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> <img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l6BcuTryPwc/X3zCxN5oiDI/AAAAAAAApOw/zCW6h0uXXDQo0bfnzenXqglnVd6V5Rs8QCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/6.png"/></strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Enabling Tracking Protection</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our next option i.e. <strong>privacy.trackingprotection.enabled </strong>enables us to completely stay non-existent to the tracking that is done through the browser. Tracking is keeping a record of your internet searches, the website you visit, data you share, etc. and this option nullifies it by blocking every kind of tracking. It works on the disconnect.me filter list.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value false i.e. it is disabled by default as messes up the authentication system of many websites. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to true. Setting the value from false to true will mean that you have now enabled this option. Once the option is enabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">privacy.trackingprotection.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> <img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zXx4wLYoROQ/X3zC29ul6gI/AAAAAAAApO4/Fh8Gebemd6A92SHalsDGeLMFTrAi1bJ8wCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/7.png"/></strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Blocking Ping tracking</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To understand the next option which is the <strong>browser.send_pings</strong>, let us first understand hyperlink auditing. It is a method of tracking where the HTML code makes your browser ping a specified URL. This URL is pinged upon the visitation of the website that you mean to visit. This method is of tracking is different from other methods as it doesn’t give users any kind of choice. It just runs in the background without the user knowing. So to shut this method of tracking, you have to go into the configuration of the Firefox and disable the <strong>browser.send_ping </strong>option. This option here makes sure that the browser blocks every kind of hyperlink auditing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value true i.e. it is enabled by default as to allow hyperlink auditing. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to false. Setting the value from true to false will mean that you have now disabled this option. Once the option is disabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">browser.send_pings</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t30b6MeSCXI/X3zC9rFfFtI/AAAAAAAApPA/P5CC9guzLbs6r5vKuX6tjkF0Mf-E5Ln8wCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/8.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Disabling URL preloading</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This <strong>browser.urlbar.speculativeConnect.enabled</strong> option helps us to control URL preloading. Whenever typing in the URL, halfway through the typing you must have noticed the auto-completion of the URL. This is known as URL preloading. How this works is when you start by typing a URL, it will send out domain queries so that it can carry on with auto-completion. And so, by disabling it, the preloading of URLs into the URL bar will stop. This helps to prevent the suggestions which you do not want or which can be presumed as insecure.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value true i.e. it is enabled by default. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to false. Setting the value from true to false will mean that you have now disabled this option. Once the option is disabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">browser.urlbar.speculativeConnect.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gxXTIGjArRE/X3zDD1tcB7I/AAAAAAAApPI/Vf5DvqFyPOs-jPDRxBoSEeKUyqLkZWaegCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/9.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Keeping Clipboard Private</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Whenever you copy, cut or paste anything from or to the website; it gets notified in detail so much as that they will know what part of the webpage you copied. This is done by keeping a track of your clipboard. Through the <strong>dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled</strong> option we can make sure that the websites do not track our data from the clipboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value true i.e. it is enabled by default. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to false. Setting the value from true to false will mean that you have now disabled this option. Once the option is disabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TqUpFTEU08I/X3zDJDOsh-I/AAAAAAAApPQ/4uSEGjBkpnYNHLhFgDmzYcKEs1kxbY9qQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/10.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Disabling EME Media</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There have been many instances recorded where medias files have been downloaded. These files were proved to be encrypted when they downloaded their self, it was hard to detect them and their data. Firefox provides us with an option through which we can make sure nothing of such sorts happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This <strong>media.eme.enabled</strong> option is set to false by default. This means that no encrypted media will be download without the user’s permission. It can be searched through the search bar. If by any chance this option is enabled, make sure to disable it as soon as possible. And if it is disabled by default then the status of this configuration will remain default as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">media.eme.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oMB-rdKBVPA/X3zDO0p3HJI/AAAAAAAApPY/_vgON8XRiikYMQRrQM0O5zaLTsji5n1jQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/11.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Restricting DRM Content</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The content you surf on the internet can never be trusted. Usually, when DRM based software’s are running on the website, they can have file-level control and even user-level control. The user-level control allows them to access, share, download, or print anything they desire. Therefore, you must be in control always. Even if your browser nags you to enable DRM content you shouldn’t fall for it because if you do not want to see it shouldn’t be able to see it. Firefox provides us with an option i.e.<strong> media.gmp-widevinecdm.enabled</strong> that allows you to restrict DRM content.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value false i.e. it is disabled by default as messes up the authentication system of many websites. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to true. Setting the value from false to true will mean that you have now enabled this option. Once the option is enabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">media.gmp-widevinecdm.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kAeiMewed2E/X3zDUTvFoGI/AAAAAAAApPg/fm8N51C9QDQJoKnskHPCrnSwKwvb72OegCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/12.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Disabling Media Navigation</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option, if enabled will allow your browser to extract information from your system and present it to the websites you visit. The data collected from the system can be forwarded to the Third-party domains as well. The thing is if you allow this option then it will collect the information about the operating system, screen resolution, type of system, FrameRate, facingMode of the mobile devices, possible access to user media, etc. And to make it even worse, they can control permissions of the audio/visual tabs in the browser as well as access the camera or microphone. Hence, we all can come to an agreement that keeping this option enabled is a major threat. And to save us from the potential threats, we just have to disable the <strong>media.gmp-widevinecdm.enabled</strong> option.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value true i.e. it is enabled by default. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to false. Setting the value from true to false will mean that you have now disabled this option. Once the option is disabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">media.navigator.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UvTwxi9Q5l8/X3zDa6U0p2I/AAAAAAAApPk/7vF5C0fd7Cw4rodyOn7hY6sjkgp26-oFgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/13.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Restricting Cookie Behaviour</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are various cookies generated when a website is visited. These cookies can be necessary which are used for the features of a website. And others are the unimportant cookies such as third-party cookies. These cookies are often the result of advertisements, widgets, and web analytics. They track your login information, shopping carts, language you use, etc. By default, the value for <strong>network.cookie.cookiebehaviour </strong>is set to 0. This value can be set between the numbers 0 to 4, where:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">0 = accept all cookie values</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1 = only accept from first-party domains</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2 = block all cookies by default</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3 = use p3p settings</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4 = storage access policy: Block cookies from trackers</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We will select value 1 here as we only want cookies from first-party domains.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">network.cookie.cookieBehavior</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rIWIKXWROu4/X3zDhJYrM0I/AAAAAAAApPs/z8p9EkxrKOAedJxqhYUQZD5tVTgPAtngACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/14.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. Once the value of the option is changed, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nr2VQYGZrEQ/X3zDmYdyJxI/AAAAAAAApPw/aGZdH8s78ZYFsFEcaUwCXF4TwyOfWEHxgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/15.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Control Referrer Header</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">While browsing the internet, a referrer header is sent to the website which is requested. This header contains the information about the page where u previously was and from where did you request the next webpage.  Usually, the Firefox will not send a referrer header from HTTPS to HTTP. Sending such information over a referrer header creates security issues as they can expose your personal information and private data. To put it simply using this option you will be able to control whether you want the referrer to be sent over the cross origins or not.  Now, this data can send to different origin domains i.e. across origins.  But Firefox’s built-in tracking protection provides a solution to it through <strong>network.http.referer.XOriginPolicy</strong> option. This value can be set between the numbers 0 to 2, where:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">0 = send the referrer in all cases</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1 = send referrer only when the base domains are the same</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2 = send referrer only on the same origin</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The default value of this option is 0 i.e. send the referrer in all cases and we will change its value to 2 i.e. send the referrer only to the same origin.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Restricting Referrer Header</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">With the previous configuration setting, we learned that we can control whether we want to send referrer headers across origins or not. Now there will be many situations where it will be necessary for you to send these referrer headers across origin or even in the same origin. Here, what you can do it restrict the header by controlling the elements of the header. The option <strong>network.http.referer.XOriginTrimmingPolicy</strong> allows us to do so.  This value can be set between the numbers 0 to 2, where:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">0 = send the full URL</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1 = send the URL without its query string</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2 = only send the origin</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The default value of this option is 0 i.e. send the full URL and we will change its value to 2 i.e. only send the origin.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">network.http.referer.XOriginTrimmingPolicy</pre>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Restricting WebGL</span> </strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">WebGL is an option provided by Firefox which turns every webpage into 3D graphics. Alas! It comes with various security flaws. It makes it possible for the attackers to target your graphic drivers along with GPU to extend of making your whole system useless. Whether you want to use such an option or not is left to user decision by Firefox when it introduced webgl.disable configurational setting. Through this option, you can disable the WebGL.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value true i.e. it is enabled by default. But if you are pro-privacy and anti-tracking like us then you should double left-click on this option to change its value to false. Setting the value from true to false will mean that you have now disabled this option. Once the option is disabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">webgl.disabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mlFvOGiUpm8/X3zEIJ6iyDI/AAAAAAAApQQ/0DdP9_dfvZQS1sU3TupAcOO4pyUy0_MCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/20.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Disabling Session Restoring</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are times where the user experiences some crashes or power outages that cause the system to shut down. If the user has some URLs opened in the browser or logged in some application they are restored when the user restarts the system. Ever since the release of Firefox 2.0 this option is enabled by default. Some users feel that this is a good functionality that helps them recover data or sessions but this poses a security threat as the if the original intended user doesn’t restart the system or if this happens on a Public system than the person who accesses the system after the restart gains the potential access of that logged-in sessions and websites that the original user was browsing. This option contains 3 possible values.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">0 = Store Extras Session data for any site</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1 = Store Extra Session data for unencrypted (non-HTTPS) sites only</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2 = Never store extra session data</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The default value of this option is 0 i.e. Store the session data for any site and we will change its value to 2 i.e. Never store any data.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">browser.sessionstore.privacy_level</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_bprDRTdxbU/X3zENmCQhrI/AAAAAAAApQY/Ew5eJDVs7O4AweirdZKoOhnGljY0FUwKACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/21.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. Once the value of the option is changed, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9YYJjLQQot8/X3zEXSz2Y6I/AAAAAAAApQg/uyhUEs1TFSEEs-FsdpqtrFyK8QopfPktACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/22.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Disabling Beacon</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">IEEE 802.12.4 says that beacon-enabled mode is to be applied through the network. It sends information about the personal network to the servers to inform them about the presence. This allows new devices to connect from time to time. It is useful to maintain network synchronization. But it not compulsory as it sends over the details about the network you are on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value true i.e. it is enabled by default. You can double left-click on this option to change its value to false. Setting the value from true to false will mean that you have now disabled this option. Once the option is disabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">beacon.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0VTPWteoZFU/X3zEe5OY4pI/AAAAAAAApQs/J9QHtmry7W8Bvs4aGzKQ8Z33u_iF_MUqgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/23.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Securing Remote Downloads</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">By default, remote safe downloads are enabled in Firefox. And we have often talked about the instances where the file that is being downloaded seems genuine but instead, it can be a malware. And you can never be too sure. Using <strong>browser.safebrowsing.downloads.remote.enabled </strong>we can be a step closer to know we are downloading safe files and nothing is remotely tagging along with the file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This option can be searched through the search bar. By default, this option is set to the value true i.e. it is enabled by default. You can double left-click on this option to change its value to false. Setting the value from true to false will mean that you have now disabled this option. Once the option is disabled, the status of the option will be changed from <strong>default</strong> to<strong> modified</strong> as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">browser.safebrowsing.downloads.remote.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8iCY2tgu0hM/X3zEk6OK6EI/AAAAAAAApQw/gO2NoNHvzagxbxeRkvDqtzoOXlVBnfuPACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/24.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Firefox Prefetching</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As the name tells, prefetching in Firefox is done to speedily load webpages for the user. A browser can always summon the parameters beforehand that it knows will be used by the websites. These parameters contain data regarding resources to be used. Hence, at any point in time, they can be request and the browser will prefetch the required information for the user. The browser will foretell the domain names that you are most likely to visit which speeds up the process of domain name resolving. This option was developed to save time on the user end but it turned out to be a security concern. Firefox can prefetch things like DNS, network, IP address, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This prefetching can be done via DNS (everything related to DNS) or HTTPS (HTTPS contents). And has been proved to be a security concern and so both DNS and HTTPs prefetching can be disabled via the following options:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>network.dns.disablePrefetch</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>network.dns.disablePrefetchFromHTTPS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Both options are set to false by default. To disable these options, change them to true and there will be no DNS and HTTPS prefetching. Once these options are disabled, the status of these options will be changed to locked just as it is shown in the image below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FXs0oBljgDg/X3zEskxSgHI/AAAAAAAApQ0/-1cP1l2SSUg_9gnRwsMNtvjxGCDWvj0DACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/25.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Another prefetcher that you can disable is network predictor. This option prefetch all the details related to the network that you are connected to. It can be disabled by setting it value to false. This value is set to be true by default. Once the change option’s value to false; its status is changed to modified as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">network.predictor.enabled</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iRgl8NKyE4s/X3zE0oWsXSI/AAAAAAAApQ4/H64j37-oDRoFTnDHfZL-QVvG9TEQLnRigCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/26.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Another option to disable to disallow the browser to prefetch network details is <strong>network.predictor.enable-prefetch. </strong>This option is allowing all the network details to be prefetched as its name suggests. It can be disabled by setting it value to false.</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">network.predictor.enable-prefetch</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PYs9beFXaMM/X3zE74Mnp8I/AAAAAAAApRA/Kll3nDbITJk0RKT1IkLn84HoF7H3_qB8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/27.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The <strong>network.prefetch-next </strong>option allows certain links to be prefetched. This is done when the website lets the browser know that certain pages are likely to be visited. Therefore, the browser downloads them beforehand for the convenience of the users.  It can be disabled by setting it value to false. This value is set to be true by default. Once the change option’s value to false; its status is changed to modified as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">network.prefetch-next</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d43Zz7h5Ib4/X3zFDGowhEI/AAAAAAAApRI/FFLQSOroSsAwqAOx9_bXSYEpdDS3J6IowCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/28.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Disabling IDN Punycode Conversion</span> </strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Before understanding this particular option, first, you need to understand the meaning of IDN support. IDN makes it possible for the website to register the domain names using the characters that are originated from their local or native language. To expand the support of these characters a new encoding was developed called “Punycode”. By default, the value network.IDN_show_punycode is false. This means IDN is enabled. But no matter how good a feature is, it can be abused. This was shown when in 2005 there was a huge rise in Spoofing and Phishing attacks using IDNs. This can be explained using the following example:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Original Domain: https://hackingarticles.in</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Pishing Domain: https://hackingarticlés.in</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Notice the é in the pishing domain. When this option is enabled it converts é to e so that users that don’t use é in their language can see it as simple e. But this conversion also makes it impossible for a user to visually differentiate between the genuine and phishing domains.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This value is set to be false by default. Once the change option’s value to true; its status is changed to modified as shown in the image below:</span></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">network.IDN_show_punycode</pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J1EkwQ9XUdI/X3zFKsfxzSI/AAAAAAAApRM/dxPwS1xV8643LE2HrE4iNpAHr9d_EOqzACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/29.png"/></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">By enabling and disabling the configurations options provided by Firefox you can achieve privacy and protection online without using plug-ins. This is a safe procedure as the third-party domain cannot track you. If you are having issues with any particular web application or authentication or media with these options enabled/disabled then what you should do is create a container in Firefox by using a temporary container plugin or profiling that is provided by Firefox. So that you are safe and cross-origin tracking isn’t done in your browser. Hence your data and personal information are safe.</span></p>
