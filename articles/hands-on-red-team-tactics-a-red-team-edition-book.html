                <p class="ai-optimize-6 ai-optimize-introduction"><span style="color: #000000;">Recently, I had the pleasure and honour of receiving an invitation to add my review for the Hands-on Red Team Tactics – A Red Team Edition book. Since the publisher released this book in September 2018, it covers all the latest trends of evasions and attacks.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-7"><span style="color: #000000;">I appreciate the great effort that  “<strong><em><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/0xhimanshu">Himanshu Sharma</a>”</em></strong> an Indian Ethical Hacker, has put in by finding security loopholes and vulnerabilities in Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Adobe, Uber, AT&amp;T, Avira, and many more, earning him fame and hall of fame listings. And, “<strong><em>Harpreet Singh</em></strong>” who has more than 5 years experience in the field of Ethical Hacking, Penetration Testing, and Red Teaming. Harpreet is an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) and Offensive Security Wireless Professional (OSWP).</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-8"><span style="color: #000000;">Adding Especial Thanks to “<a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rajchandel"><strong><em>Raj Chandel</em></strong></a>” and “<a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/aarti-singh-353698114"><strong><em>Aarti Singh</em></strong></a>” for assisting me to comprehend the concept of red team operation in a most effective way.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-9"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>While reading this book I found it has covered some very advanced and useful tools for performing red team practice that I generally use while performing red team operation, therefore, I feel this book is virtuous resource for those who wish to enhance their skills from traditional VAPT.</em></span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-10"><span style="color: #800000;">Book Overview</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-11"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Teaming enhances security by performing simulated attacks on the organization to detect network and system vulnerabilities. Hands-On Red Team Tactics starts with an overview of pentesting and Red Teaming, before giving an introduction to few of the latest pentesting tools. You will then move on to exploring Metasploit and getting to grips with Armitage. Once you have studied the basics, you will understand Cobalt Strike basic, usage and how to set up a team server of Cobalt Strike.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-12"><span style="color: #000000;">You will discover some common lesser-known techniques for pivoting and how to pivot over SSH, before using Cobalt Strike to pivot. This comprehensive guide demonstrates the advanced methods of post-exploitation using Cobalt Strike and introduces you to Command-and-control servers (C2) and Redirectors. All this will help you achieve persistence using Beacons and Data Exfiltration, and will also give you the chance to run through the methodology to use Red Team activity tools like Empire during a Red Team activity on Active Directory and Domain Controller.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-13"><span style="color: #000000;">By the end of the book, you will have learned advanced penetration testing tools, techniques to get reverse shells over encrypted channels and processes for post-exploitation. In addition to this, you will explore frameworks such as Empire which include maintaining persistent access, staying untraceable, and getting reverse connections over different C2 covert channels.</span></p>
