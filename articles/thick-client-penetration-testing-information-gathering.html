</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Information gathering by using CFF Explorer</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You can directly install CFF Explorer from here: â€“ <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://ntcore.com/files/ExplorerSuite.exe">https://ntcore.com/files/ExplorerSuite.exe</a></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">CFFÂ ExplorerÂ was designed to make PE editing as easy as possible, but without losing sight on the portable executableâ€™s internal structure. This application includes a series of tools which might help not only reverse engineers but also programmers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SvFj7ToX9GM/YBmdBQlW2ZI/AAAAAAAAtV4/KAEjW5sDujQP0QUChSSY9npxMxR21yQEwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/79.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Letâ€™s open up the CFF explorer. Basically, CFF explorer is used to checking how the binary is built. Having knowledge on what languages are used for building the binary is really useful because if it is built using Java, C, C++, ML, Alâ€¦ we can look for vulnerabilities like Buffer overflow if it is built using C-sharp.net kind of languages it is very easy to decompile the application and reverse engineered</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So, without wasting of much time quickly open up the DVTA.exe by navigating to <strong>File &gt; open &gt; DVTA.exe</strong> as shown in below image.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LtT_gW6Encs/YBmddX7qYuI/AAAAAAAAtWA/9PIHCbOvtfIHU94zFJCKoVq76HrjQTuRgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/80.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Letâ€™s see which type of juicy information we get â€¦</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So if you notice by 2<sup>nd</sup> line this is a Portable Executable 32.NET Assembly and Microsoft Visual .NET is used to build this. So, as you can see this binary is built using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET and itâ€™s a .NET assembly so that we can de-compile this application very easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u28DPqr03_E/YBmdh1m2suI/AAAAAAAAtWE/2SeUSlZOZJwNGHXdnwOAUCQuwY1yPsCvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/81.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This information is enough to decompile the application easily.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Information Gathering by using Sysinternals Suite</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Download and install Sysinternal Suite: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://download.sysinternals.com/files/SysinternalsSuite.zip">https://download.sysinternals.com/files/SysinternalsSuite.zip</a></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once the download complete, install it. Installation is pretty much easy there is no need to do changes in installation just simply press next and next until installation doesnâ€™t finish.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FJ-luwB3-WQ/YBmdnCoWNzI/AAAAAAAAtWI/ztz2LjuoeLEegfjVVF-0rkfWCMTqHb3mQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/82.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Letâ€™s begin with a tool TCP View from the Sysinternals Suite</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M04nQ6PaDc0/YBmdr5ZedFI/AAAAAAAAtWM/FECJNMqwZlIvpEutbIDCYBuBqBvy0NDZgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/83.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Open up the application TCP view and just after opening the application you can see the machine is making network communications and what weâ€™re interested in is DVTA application.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So, the thing is we have to gather information like where these applications communicating such as the Destination IP address.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wpDbv7vyRx4/YBmdxXltt8I/AAAAAAAAtWQ/FAW1rt2KmZAKtddLrE7TDf3PWpAWRtcRgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/84.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To do this launch the modified DVTA application and see what happensâ€¦ ðŸ¤”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">First of all, configure the server to your local Ip address or the loopback address and the login to the DVTA application with the user credentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X9jSvx4nezM/YBmd1onKIYI/AAAAAAAAtWY/KLBq5PPUEsUcVxPsDEeWTE-qZ7pFZe_qgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/85.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now, you can see there is a new entry in TCP view showing DVTA.exe processes and the local address is 127.0.0.1 and the remote address that is communicating with localhost in this case because itâ€™s the loopback address where the database is installed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Kj7jxGqtxo/YBmd7Vktf_I/AAAAAAAAtWc/pML844ZSA9Evuz382ZOE9S2zHYns7KWBACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/86.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In this way, we can figure out the IP addresses that our applications are communicating with. So, we have completed the first step towards the information gathering.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Letâ€™s move to another tool from the Sysinternals Suite called Procmon.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Information Gathering by using Procmon</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Basically, Procmon is a process monitor that helps us to understand the file system changes and what is being accessed on the file system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Letâ€™s open up the application Procmon which you can find in the folder of Sysinternals suite.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Here weâ€™re using 32-bit of version.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ex2H-vQKjfU/YBmeA961p3I/AAAAAAAAtWk/8eWAkGoZ98w_efPwwnJTJ7wGp9Tj-WIPgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/87.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Just after the opening of Procmon application, you can see this process monitor is showing lotâ€™s of traffic and the reason behind of that is it picks up all of the processes and shows the output of all the processes In its window.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8vIkSZkLUxI/YBmeGgfm2WI/AAAAAAAAtWs/i3iz-JY_9uc6AYtMCGXnfKHlHn4njUtbwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/88.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This becomes complex for us to understand the process that weâ€™re interested in. To reduce that complexity lets set up a filter by navigating to <strong>Filter &gt; Filter </strong>or just simply press Ctrl+L</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GWc0rNyEDBw/YBmeLcGXTTI/AAAAAAAAtWw/Pf7rLvRokXwMtHYOWl4EVJ_cAuLJ1aybgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/89.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Select the Attribute to <strong>Process Name</strong> is <strong>DVTA.exe</strong> because this is the only process that what weâ€™re interested in and <strong>ADD</strong> the filter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-25HjabZXOrc/YBmeWJKwZRI/AAAAAAAAtW4/rDaol71dmuAi9aUFUNfQZYOiwvof4WJOACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/90.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now you are going to see the screen empty because DVTA is not currently running.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gqUOoWrEk44/YBmean8-4HI/AAAAAAAAtXA/0CtPMOqtbCQ8B5XSFbJuwNfs8E5bEdRQwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/91.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So, without wasting of time go back to modified DVTA application folder and run the DVTA.exe </span><span style="color: #000000;">Now just by the opening of DVTA, there is traffic generated only for the DVTA.exe file. </span><span style="color: #000000;">So now they become more interesting and easier to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--C0ERcPujdQ/YBmeetHKGqI/AAAAAAAAtXI/DfVM1Qsp0EgE5ogYf2nK04bbbglk90ZYgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/92.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now configure our server to 127.0.0.1. we have configured the server already in previous articles weâ€™re doing this again to understand what changes are being made in the file system when we configure it. </span><span style="color: #000000;">But before doing this clear your screen to reduce the complexity by navigating to <strong>Edit &gt; Clear Display</strong> so that when we press configure server button, we can only see which changes being made.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Just after hitting the Configure server button, you can see there is instantly lots of traffic generated as shown below In the image.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vKsoqVBFiMM/YBmejxI-tlI/AAAAAAAAtXM/hFGXgL76l9A3Vp9aSmw3ig_YcM-sgLBhQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/93.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now, what we interested in we want to understand what happens when we clicked on configure server button. So just scroll down to the output and see what we can find anything interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are lots of registry entry being accessed and at the bottom, there are some files that are being accessed such as create the file, Query Network open information file, Close File â€¦</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1G7v55GTQOA/YBmeu_cAxBI/AAAAAAAAtXc/JDGrCkcT3NMDHRXDDwvERDAK2XnG6AXrACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/94.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">so, it looks like these files are something which is being accessed by DVTA.exe when we try configuring the IP address. So quickly open it up and see what it has. We can directly jump from process monitor to the location of this file by giving it <strong>a right-click and then navigate to Jump TOâ€¦</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vei9kSb921s/YBmezyHi6GI/AAAAAAAAtXg/dxvTRQ54poET-4wKaGD4oKSUQeMIasOxQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/95.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It will redirect you the location of that file changed in the file system are being made as shown below also it automatically highlights to the file where changes are being implied.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gO9Lmmn63fI/YBme4rk1UFI/AAAAAAAAtXk/wL2XgqfiwKE46D9sq_KkNa7BUtKADJ69gCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/96.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now letâ€™s open up the DVTA.exe XML configuration file in you favourite XML viewer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Itâ€™s gonna very interesting as you can see the server is configured to <strong>127.0.0.1</strong> exactly the same IP address that we have entered earlier and looks when we click on configure the server the Ip address is taken from the text box and placed hereâ€¦ ðŸ¤”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from these entries here we have some other interesting entries if you notice there is a database name which is <strong>DVTA</strong> â€¦ if you remember this is the name of the database we have used when creating a database in SQL Server Express. Also, there is the user name and the password for the database but it seems like the password is Encrypted but if you observe just right below that there is an AES encryption key possibly used for decrypting the Encrypted value and apart from that there is <strong>IV value which is probably used with the AES Encryption</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uwf9sqV4pXM/YBme9Zty1qI/AAAAAAAAtXo/ZXKH-s8JwBkdPS_zsQXo5K9Mr8NxRy2rACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/97.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Now the main thing to be noted is that when we tried configuring the server in the applicationâ€¦ the application is accessing this DVTA.exe.config file and it is trying to place the IP address place there then we have also noticed some more interesting information such as Encrypted Database password and the AES key.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Letâ€™s open up the DVTA application and login to the application by using user credentials as shown below and on the other tab process monitor start capturing the traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WSVLhAOLgiE/YBmfqh3czJI/AAAAAAAAtX8/VdI7xp_Sg84tIq9GAsRD5X1zTmMDFCcfgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/98.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As you can see, we have successfully logged in to the application also you can verify the user credentials by navigating to View profile. Now close the tab directly without doing Logout.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-krZYFT0QBjk/YBmfyWUxY_I/AAAAAAAAtYA/QnVN43O3m0ICpdtV_Strn5i33xCOUizbwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/99.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now again open the DVTA application and if you noticed it doesnâ€™t ask to enter the credentials again. That means it is storing the credentials somewhere or it may be storing the session somewhere in the client. So, what we will try to do is we will close the application and clear the procmon display once again so that weâ€™ll have to deal with less number of entries and once again weâ€™ll open DVTA.exe and we already notice we didnâ€™t Logout so it will directly bring you to the main screen</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nLHQA4Oab3Q/YBmf5XxDnCI/AAAAAAAAtYE/nSaLAn49mKUn32lyT76dBjzGYMO5gZ74ACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/100.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now, letâ€™s see if there is anything interesting happening on the file system when we trying to open this application with the existing session. So, keep scrolling down to the output screen until we donâ€™t find something interesting and if you see there is a <strong>registry specific to our application name DVTA and inside that there seem to be some keys like username, is Logged inâ€¦ etc</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So, it seems like interesting letâ€™s quickly open up the registry entry by giving it a <strong>right-click and navigating to Jump to</strong> or you can directly <strong>jump to</strong> file by pressing <strong>ctrl+J</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sgMHI6BooLI/YBmf-KHmriI/AAAAAAAAtYM/1tLcHIbYdxMGj8OoNnNpRLPcQ1sYe3OVACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/101.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It will open up the Registry entry. As we can see it has a couple of keys like <strong>Email, Is Logged in, Password, and Username</strong>. So basically, this application is storing the credentials here and it is also checking if the user is already logged in or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3qA9HGe46_0/YBmgEcvIz5I/AAAAAAAAtYQ/xoqhJHw3TJ0q-TSyzk97EJYNN6eGo94swCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/102.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And that means if you change the isLoggedIn value true to false then it will probably ask you to enter the login credentials again even if you are already logged in.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Hmmâ€¦ exited Letâ€™s do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SDBozZj5G9s/YBmgJ5FL7UI/AAAAAAAAtYY/66Gv_fnwZy4gGCHZqeSpS2Fux7mej4DwQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/103.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Letâ€™s check that by closing the DVTA application and opening it once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When you open the DVTA application again it will ask you to enter the login credentials again so that means our acknowledges are correct. If the application finds this registry entry with the value true it will not ask you for login.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VnhuuXMae6o/YBmgOhMHFuI/AAAAAAAAtYg/ND0SK3BWYUMIt-Zu3U6uFN3-zAeuqQPXgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/104.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So, this can be used for some interesting attacks for example if we change the user name and password In the registry entry, we can easily trick to the application to believe that the particular user is already logged in with his credentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This looks very interesting attack â€¦ isnâ€™t itâ€¦?? Letâ€™s do it</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Change the Password value to Vijay to paras or youâ€™re on own as by giving a double click to the registry of Password as shown below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0vLaWM026n8/YBmgW8eAioI/AAAAAAAAtYk/MZZhzVBOgUAmKuvMsgZuYuaaIiZ3daWSQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/105.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Same again change the username value vijay to paras or your own name and hit ok</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dUSX0I3bmVk/YBmgb_UzFTI/AAAAAAAAtYs/xNOkObWaxH0PME3XM9nAk1HuthwJzDgJQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/106.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Letâ€™s check what happens if we once again open the DVTA application.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As you can see, we directly logged in to the application without entering the login credentials. So, as we see we can simply trick the application to logged in to application directly by doing changes in the registry entry.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KX-wUvnfJCE/YBmghiWGe_I/AAAAAAAAtYw/9eQtgPGWnbsCD5QtxbcHXSRGc_zaA48ggCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/107.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Now what we learnt from all of these processes that the application is storing login credentials in the registry entry.</em></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Information gathering by using Wireshark</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You can download Wireshark by visiting the official page of Wireshark: â€“ <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html">https://www.wireshark.org/download.html</a></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After downloading the Wireshark install it on your system by hitting next and next it doesnâ€™t need any changes in the installation. By installing it run the Wireshark and the interface looks similar like as shown in below image.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Since we are using loopback address letâ€™s choose loopback traffic capture</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RtC10p3I1_8/YBmgwEjIZ4I/AAAAAAAAtY8/9SS1zpkBuVUV4uMcxBDkQp5xJpMFKrFCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/108.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now go back to the modified DVTA application and login to the application by using login credentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XPP9r8brWkc/YBmg3rqM50I/AAAAAAAAtZE/TfoIe_O4mTMFtVT1JZgiT5TRSIl4NdDRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/109.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Just after login to application come back to the Wireshark and you can see there are lots of traffic going there just refresh the capture and again login to the DVTA application and just after hitting the login button come back to Wireshark and its better to stop the capture immediately after clicking the login button so it wonâ€™t capture unnecessary traffic as shown below in image where I opened two different tabs one of Wireshark and another one is DVTA application just to see how it capture the traffic when I press the login button.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7cfO90GEm7w/YBmg9V8-U5I/AAAAAAAAtZI/2bHHLJN2I6cVuexVkhUbtCD5h9CJ8omGwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/110.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now what weâ€™re interested in is to understand how this login is making communication with the server. If you look there are some packets that uses UDP protocol so letâ€™s open it in UDP stream and then letâ€™s see what we can find.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cn0efsGjx9Y/YBmhDwqwq-I/AAAAAAAAtZQ/nCA4v9KEVL0aJeHkXRb_GOwieWUW-2LRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/111.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When you open that packet, you can see this is a packet containing a request to SQL Server. You can see there is an SQL Express and the hostname where the SQL server is running.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So, this packet shows that we are making a network connection with the SQL server and this is enough also you can capture the whole traffic of DVTA application how the application is communicating with the server.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4TP7K2Z_PPs/YBmhKlxaLvI/AAAAAAAAtZU/lN5as8f1O_sEN5vsyGbR1As3xbI5R1W3gCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/112.png"/></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Now the key takeaway here is that the application is making some SQL connections when you are trying to interact with it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the next part, we will talk about different attack vectors.</span></p>
