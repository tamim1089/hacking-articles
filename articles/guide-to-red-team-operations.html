                <p class="ai-optimize-6 ai-optimize-introduction">In this post you will get to know all about RED TEAM Operation and Practice, idea for this article came from the SANS SEC564 by Joe Vest and James Tubbervile.</p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-7"><span style="color: #800000;">Introduction to Red Team</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-8"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Teaming comes under the level of assessment in the information security domain. Red Teamers have to identify the risk to the network infrastructure of an organisation as a measure of pre-evaluation so that the execution of engagement can be carried properly. In order to determine such risks, it is the primary responsibility of Red Team operators to recognise potential threats or vulnerability. Various tools, whether open-source or commercial, can be used by Red Teamers to acknowledge vulnerabilities and to exploit them to their advantage. However, the Red Teaming approach is more in-depth than what most potential attackers follow because they are attempting to find a single vulnerability, whereas security professionals need to find all possible vulnerabilities for a given infrastructure in order to assess the associated risk. </span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-8"><span style="color: #000000;">Attackers typically only target a single vulnerability for a specific exploit because to do otherwise would increase the possibility for detection. Nevertheless, Red Teaming should test for all types of attacks to provide a complete security assessment. Appropriate situational awareness of security infrastructure is a result of detailed Red Team research. But the process of Red Team will not be sufficient in identifying risk; the organization should continue maintaining the security measures from their end in order to appropriately manage risk and provide security protection.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-9"><span style="color: #800000;">What is the Red Team?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-10"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Team is a group of highly skilled pentesters that are summoned by an organization to test their defence and improve its effectiveness. Basically, it is the way of utilizing strategies, systems, and methodology to simulate real-world scenarios so as to prepare and measure the security defences of the organisation. The objective of the Red Team is to simulate the real-world attacks in order to measure the organization’s defences and their incident response Team. Red Team follows the Roles of Engagement (RoE).  </span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-11"><span style="color: #800000;">What are the aspects of the Red Team?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-12"><span style="color: #000000;">Threat Emulation</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-13"><span style="color: #000000;">Operational Impacts</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-14"><span style="color: #000000;">Comparing Red Team Engagement to other security testing types</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-15"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Team Operator Traits</span></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="ai-optimize-16"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Threat Emulation:</strong> </span></h5>
<p class="ai-optimize-16"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the process of mimicking the TTP’s of a specific threat. Emulation can be done of various attacks such as – zero attacks, script kiddie to the advanced adversary or a specific threat like botnets, ransomware, DDOS, etc. No matter what the scenario, the TTP outline by the scenario drive the rules a Red Team must follow to perform an engagement. When creating the threat emulation scenario, that threat’s key component should be defined. When in Practice it can be difficult to simulate the real-world scenario in an exact manner. </span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-16"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, the main focus of the Red Team is should be on the key component and then use their own TTP to fill in the gaps. The biggest challenge in threat emulation is simulating the threat to a level where an analyst believes the threat is real, Approaches range from using real malware to developing custom malware that models a real threat, to using tools that generate the indicators of compromise (IOCs) an attack from a real threat leaves behind. In any case, effective planning and determination of the critical components of a threat will lead to better threat emulation design.</span></p>
<h5 class="ai-optimize-17"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Operational Impacts:</strong> </span></h5>
<p class="ai-optimize-17"><span style="color: #000000;">Operational Impacts are actions or effects performed against a target designed to demonstrate physical, informational or operational weaknesses in security. These effects can be as general as performing a denial of service attack or more specific such as using high jacked ICS equipment to control a city’s power grid. It is operational impacts that distinguish Red Teamer from others. Operational Impacts can be very effective in demonstrating realistic impacts against a target. The level of depth and of the impact can be as ‘painful’ as an organization is willing to explore. These impacts are typically performed against live production systems to have the highest level of fidelity but can be executed on test and development environments if they are representative systems.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-18"><span style="color: #800000;">Comparing Red Team Engagement to other security testing types</span></h3>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-19"><span style="color: #000000;">Difference b/w Pentesting and Red Team: </span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-19"><span style="color: #000000;">Pentesting is used to monitor control and identify vulnerability in order to secure them along with testing the efficiency of the vulnerability management process. It further helps to lay the foundation for security policies. Basically, Pentesting is testing the security environment of infrastructure in order to find and patch vulnerabilities in a limited span of time, so that we can eliminate the false positive scenarios. In comparison to Red Team, Pentesting is the most rigorous and methodical testing of a network, hardware or application. During Pentesting, the pentesters search for vulnerabilities, analysis them and exploit them. Penetration tests are well defined and usually takes up to one to two weeks for the whole process.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-20"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Team includes tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) by adversaries. Red -Team is just like Pentesting in many ways but it is more targeted. A Red-Team overall accesses and evaluates various areas of security through a multi-layered approach. The mission is to present real-world scenarios and hard facts in an attempt to improve the company’s response. Every area of security defines how the target will respond or how it is accessed. It follows the concept of defence in depth; therefore, the target must be tested on each layer. The goal of the Red Team is to not find as many vulnerabilities as possible but to test the detection and response capabilities of infrastructure along with their security environment.</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-21"><span style="color: #000000;">Difference b/w Read Team and Vulnerability Assessment: </span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-21"><span style="color: #000000;">Vulnerability assessment is the process of analysing of a system that focuses on finding the vulnerability and prioritizing them by risk. Validation or exploitation of a vulnerability is not performed during while vulnerability assessment. When compared to Red Team engagement vulnerability assessment doesn’t take priority. A Red Team may not use any vulnerabilities. They may generate an operational impact that any insider can perform to test the response of an insider attack. Red Teams rarely if ever run common vulnerability assessment tools as they are loud and generate more traffic than a typical Red Team engagement is willing to accept.</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-22"><span style="color: #000000;">Difference b/w Red Team and Blue Team: </span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-22"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Teams are the attackers whereas Blue Teams are the defenders. Red Team members adeptly execute all forms of digital attack, as well as social engineering and other methods to find ways to break into a company’s systems – but they must adhere to employment agreements or legal contracts that prevent them from disclosing their findings to anyone but the company being tested. While Team almost always works as employees of the company that is undergoing the testing, and are usually members of the IT Security or Data Security divisions of the company’s IT group. Blue Teams have two major areas of operations. Their only focus is to find the vulnerability and patch them as it seems fit. They can also keep providing security during the Red Team engagement.</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-23"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Team operator traits </span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-24"><span style="color: #000000;">An effective Red Team is comprised of a team of individuals who can contribute the overall success. Diversity is crucial, but the Team as a whole must be comprised of the core operator traits. A Team can be even more successful when multiple Team members contribute in multiple areas.</span></p>
<h5 class="ai-optimize-25"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Core Operator Traits :</strong></span></h5>
<p class="ai-optimize-26"><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cFXfn809ApE/XUcbmHsOMxI/AAAAAAAAf1Q/Hn__gH1qqIsqFHDpxCjF1sCIwXTYSvvSgCLcBGAs/s1600/1.jpg"/></span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-27"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Teams are given opportunities to touch and manipulate target networks in ways typically only done by real threats. Full-scale Red Team operations can allow Red Team operators to really put on their bad guy hats, engagement can be very intellectually stimulating and enjoyable for an operator, but operators must respect target organizations. A great deal of trust is placed on an operator. It is common for a Red Team to position themselves to do serious damage or embarrassment to an organization. And with all this, each Red Team operator should comply the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-28"><span style="color: #000000;">Executes engagement requirements as directed</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-29"><span style="color: #000000;">Complies with all laws, regulations, policies, programs, and Rules of Engagement</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-30"><span style="color: #000000;">Implements the Team’s operational methodology and TTPs</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-31"><span style="color: #000000;">Identifies and has input to target environment deficiencies</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-32"><span style="color: #000000;">Researches and develops new exploit tools and tests tools for functionality</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-33"><span style="color: #000000;">Performs Open Source Intelligence as required for the engagement</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-34"><span style="color: #000000;">Identifies and assesses actions that reveal system vulnerabilities and capabilities</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-35"><span style="color: #000000;">Assists the Red Team Lead in development of the final engagement report</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-36"><span style="color: #000000;">Performs Physical Assessment support under the direction of Red Team Lead</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-37"><span style="color: #800000;">Why do we need Red Team?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-38"><span style="color: #000000;">To challenge the extend of an organisation’s defences so that when and if a real attack happens then they stay protected or come up with a counter measure. For example, a group of hackers has a goal of stealing critical data from a target. A targeted phishing attack tests the end user’s awareness of the attack. The payload of the attack tests the network and host defences against delivery of malware and ultimately code execution, If the attack does trigger a defence, the response tests the defender’s actions in identifying, responding or stopping the attack. In any case, the entire scope of security defence is analysed. A highly skilled Red Teamer can tune their attacks to identify where the failure points are by turning up or down that ‘volume’ of an attack.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-39"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Teams are able to execute custom threat as part of their engagement. It can test a subset of security of new threat type or validate the effectiveness of security controls against a new or specific threat types. Threat emulation scenarios are a valuable distinguisher of Red Teaming from other types of security assessments and can be used to understand how an organization stands up to new zero-day attack.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-40"><span style="color: #800000;">Working of Red Teamers?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-41"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Team tactics contains a full scope, multi layered diverse attacks to simulate real world attacks to measure the security alignments that are applied. Assessments of Red Team starts with reconnaissance to collect as much information as possible about the target in order to determine the way best way possible to exploit it. This collecting of information also helps to build attacking environment and selection of tools. Most of the working of Red Team is on offensive side rather than defensive. Once the remote access to exploited system is managed and stabilised, the actual attacking takes action.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-42"><span style="color: #800000;">What is the specialization of Red Teamer?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-43"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Teamers must understand and be an expert in a diverse set of technologies such as :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-44"><span style="color: #000000;">Different operating systems and software packages</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-45"><span style="color: #000000;">Diverse networking protocols</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-46"><span style="color: #000000;">Custom applications and protocols</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-47"><span style="color: #000000;">Physical security defences</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-48"><span style="color: #000000;">Social interaction</span></li>

<h3 class="ai-optimize-58"><span style="color: #800000;">What are the Pre-Engagement Data Requirements?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-59"><span style="color: #000000;">The pre-engagement data requirements are :                                                                                              </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-60"><span style="color: #000000;">Target POC list</span></li>

<li class="ai-optimize-65"><span style="color: #000000;">Analysis of Potential Attack Vectors and Tools</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-66"><span style="color: #800000;">What is a Red Team Standard Attack Platform?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-67"><span style="color: #000000;">A standard attack platform is the common set of tools and hardware used by a Red Team to perform an engagement. The term standard is critical. Using a standard platform allows for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-68"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Better Logging:</strong> A common platform shares the same base build, directory structure, and built-in data capture capability.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-69"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Easier Deconfliction:</strong> A common set of tools and payloads, along with standard logging, can help an organization quickly work through the deconfliction process.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-70"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Common Baseline:</strong> A common base provides a stable, functional environment for a Red Team to operate.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-71"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Access to Better Toolset :</strong> A shared platform is built from the knowledge of many people. The best tools, references, and guidelines can be contributed from multiple senior Red Team members to include their expertise in the toolbox.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-72"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Custom Tools Work Across Attack Platforms :</strong> Red Teams often build tools. If these tools are built to work on a standard attack platform, they will work for all Red Team operators.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-73"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tool Vetting :</strong> In some cases, a Blue Team or customer requires tools to be vetted as threat faithful. When using a standard attack platform, a tool vetting process is often required before including a tool. This way, all tools are managed and validated before use. Tool validation is often due to a fear the Red Team tools may cause damage to a system.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-74"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Consistent Processes :</strong> Using a common baseline help enable a common set of processes. A common set of processes can allow the skills and knowledge of senior operators to be used by junior operators. This can greatly enhance an engagement’s success and better use limited resources.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-75"><span style="color: #800000;">What are Red Team engagement roles and responsibility?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-76"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>White Cell</strong> : A white cell basically enforces the rules of the engagement to ensure neither Red Team nor defender activities cause unexpected alerts or problems on the target environment. It helps to co-ordinate activities to ensure engagement goals.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-77"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Engagement Control Group</strong> : It represents the management of target environment as well as provides required information that is necessary for constructing valid scenarios. Also, it helps to establish blacklist if its needed.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-78"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Physical Access Team</strong> :  The sole purpose of Physical Access Team in Red Team is to enter gates, buildings, offices, server rooms, etc. along with demonstrate physical access to systems and network in order to gain access to devices or anything desirable.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-79"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>General Guidelines for Red Teaming :</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-80"><span style="color: #000000;">All Red Team members are responsible for safeguarding all customers data. This said data includes Personally Identifiable information (PII), Industry BBP.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-81"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Teamers should work under Privacy Act Information.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-82"><span style="color: #000000;">They should avoid data mining of files containing privacy act, medical, justice, worship or religious pursuit or any other protected or privilege information.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-83"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Team normally authors the exploitation of files, e-mail, and/or message traffic stored on the network or communications transiting the network, including everything else. However, each Red Team member must ensure that all the information they exploit is necessary and within the scope of engagement.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-84"><span style="color: #000000;">Red Team must not modify the data they find or conduct DDOS unless someone specifically requests it. The Red Team must not intentionally degrade or disrupt the normal operations of the targeted system being exploited.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-85"><span style="color: #800000;">How to handle client data?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-86"><span style="color: #000000;">Client data should be handled with extreme care. The information collected during an engagement can be misused if fallen in wrong hands.</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-87"><span style="color: #000000;">Permission :</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-88"><span style="color: #000000;">The ROE should identify permissions for Authorization :</span></p>
<ul>

<li class="ai-optimize-90"><span style="color: #000000;">Data Collection</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-91"><span style="color: #000000;">Data Leverage</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-92"><span style="color: #000000;">Target Space</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-93"><span style="color: #000000;">User Groups</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-94"><span style="color: #000000;">Policy Controls :</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-95"><span style="color: #000000;">It is implemented by the Red Team and it includes :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-96"><span style="color: #000000;">A Red Team non-disclosure agreement</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-97"><span style="color: #000000;">Data training which means identifying and avoiding PII, PA data, etc.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-98"><span style="color: #000000;">Ethics training</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-99"><span style="color: #000000;">Individual Background Checks</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-100"><span style="color: #000000;">Physical Controls :</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-101"><span style="color: #000000;">Apply multi-layered physical controls to protect the engagement tools and operating system from any kind of loss. Therefore, Red Teamers should familiarize themselves with the physical controls that are in place. Such security mechanisms include :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-102"><span style="color: #000000;">Tools, computing systems and costumer data be stored inside isolated room secured with cipher lock and controlled only by Red Team.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-103"><span style="color: #000000;">Minimize contact between the Team and external entities.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-104"><span style="color: #000000;">When not in use, remove all data and equipment and place them into lockable cases, safes, or storage cabinets.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-105"><span style="color: #000000;">Secure laptops and hard drives at all times during travel.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-106"><span style="color: #000000;">All visitors to Res Team space should be escorted and signed in and out.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-107"><span style="color: #000000;">Allow only Red Team personnel with need to know to handle customer data.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-108"><span style="color: #000000;">Encrypt data for transmission during off-site engagement.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-109"><span style="color: #000000;">Software Controls :</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-110"><span style="color: #000000;">The following software controls ensure the confidentiality, anonymity, and safety of information and should always be employed in whatever context :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-111"><span style="color: #000000;">Encrypt and protect each host and guest operating system with a strong password.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-112"><span style="color: #000000;">Utilize a host-based firewall specific to the engagement for each host and guest operating system.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-113"><span style="color: #000000;">Store data and tools utilized during an engagement in an encrypted container and move them to the working directory only when needed.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-114"><span style="color: #000000;">Remove all Red Team tools and software from the target environment at the end of the engagement.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-115"><span style="color: #000000;">Add all access, movement, and use of data and tools to the OPLOG (Operations Logs).</span></li>

<h4 class="ai-optimize-117"><span style="color: #000000;">Common repository :</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-118"><span style="color: #000000;">All the Red Teamers assigned to engagement should have access to a common repository.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-119"><span style="color: #000000;">Store it within an encrypted volume</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-120"><span style="color: #000000;">Ensure the encrypted volume always resides on a centralized server/NAS/file share.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-121"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be mountable or accessible only after authentication</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-122"><span style="color: #000000;">Repository layout should be in Hierarchy.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-123"><span style="color: #000000;">Data Collection</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-124"><span style="color: #000000;">Data collection is the core of every engagement. It is directly proportionate to the success of engagement. in other words, the collection of data drives the value of the engagement. Data collection should be complete with the enabling of replication of activities and results. It should also help you to identify the items of significant interest to the operators. Final Data sets should include :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-125"><span style="color: #000000;">Pre-event data</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-126"><span style="color: #000000;">Execution data</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-127"><span style="color: #000000;">Operator logs</span></li>

<li class="ai-optimize-129"><span style="color: #000000;">Screenshots</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-130"><span style="color: #000000;">Post event data (data archive, closeout brief, final report)</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-131"><span style="color: #000000;">Execution data requirements</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-132"><span style="color: #000000;">Under this, the Team must ensure that they safely log all data they handle. They should log all activities related to Red Team operations as the engagement begins and only terminate logging after they complete all activity related to the engagement. The events they should log are :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-133"><span style="color: #000000;">Scanning activities</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-134"><span style="color: #000000;">Exploiting events</span></li>

</ul>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-153"><span style="color: #000000;">Operator Logs </span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-154"><span style="color: #000000;">As stated earlier, all the activity should be logged accurately and concisely. at the very least, the following information must be collected and logged for each action performed :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-155"><span style="color: #000000;">Start Timestamp (UTC Recommended)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-156"><span style="color: #000000;">End Timestamp (UTC Recommended)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-157"><span style="color: #000000;">Source IP (Attack/Test System IP address)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-158"><span style="color: #000000;">Destination IP (Target IP Address)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-159"><span style="color: #000000;">Destination Port (Target Port)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-160"><span style="color: #000000;">Destination System Name</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-161"><span style="color: #000000;">Pivot IP (if applicable, list IP of any system used as a pivot, port forwarder, etc.)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-162"><span style="color: #000000;">Pivot Port (if applicable, list send and receive ports leveraged in pivot system)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-163"><span style="color: #000000;">URL (Note, it is important to capture the FULL URL of the Target instance)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-164"><span style="color: #000000;">Tool/Application</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-165"><span style="color: #000000;">Command (Full command)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-166"><span style="color: #000000;">Description (why or for what purpose was the action was performed)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-167"><span style="color: #000000;">Output</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-168"><span style="color: #000000;">Result</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-169"><span style="color: #000000;">System Modification (Modified file, dropped binary location, enabled functions, etc.)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-170"><span style="color: #000000;">Comments</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-171"><span style="color: #000000;">Screenshot</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-172"><span style="color: #000000;">Operator Name</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-173"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, when creating log entries, documenting actions, uploading/downloading files, dropping binaries, etc. It is recommended to document this in the YYYYMMDDHHMM_IPDescription format.</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-174"><span style="color: #000000;">Automated Data Collection </span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-175"><span style="color: #000000;">Where ever the chance, the Team should use tools and scripts available to capture and consolidate engagement data. Data collected by automated tools will never be enough for Red Team. However, if employed properly, complements the Red Team workflow and enables the operator to continue operations with the manual capture of data pertinent to the activity performed.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-176"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Terminal logs</strong></span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-177"><span style="color: #000000;">All Red Teams engagement systems should have automated collection of raw terminal data. Each command should be prefixed with operator’s IP and UTC timestamp. It is more important that data is accurately captured rather than being captured in a novel way.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-178"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Commercial tools</strong></span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-179"><span style="color: #000000;">Most tools that the Red Team uses log activities to some extent, but different tools maintain logs in various locations, and many require the operator to trigger log generation. In any case it is quite handy to use commercial tools.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-180"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Consolidation</strong></span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-181"><span style="color: #000000;">Daily transfer of these logs to the engagement repository is recommended. Preference should be to create a backup script that copies each set of logs to the repository when executed at the end of the day.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-182"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Screenshots</strong></span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-183"><span style="color: #000000;">People often meet details concerning Red Team actions with disbelief. Even when the Team has undeniable evidence of access to a highly restrictive network or physical area, target personnel sometimes struggle to concede that they obtained access. And so, provide the proof whenever required.</span></p>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-184"><span style="color: #800000;">What is Red Team Engagement flow?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-185"><span style="color: #000000;">The Red Team engagement flow is a dynamic process but can be managed through distinct steps. the flow of Red Team includes </span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-186"><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AXGIPFYfmkA/XUccq7c0VvI/AAAAAAAAf10/qrHTsCA5z6c-5GMEteud13iAhg0jOtNigCLcBGAs/s1600/4.jpg"/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="ai-optimize-187"><span style="color: #000000;">Engagement planning starts when first contacted by the customer and realistically doesn’t end until the day of execution. It determines the objectives of the working of the Team. Engagement planning includes :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-188"><span style="color: #000000;">Rules of engagement</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-189"><span style="color: #000000;">Management risk</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-190"><span style="color: #000000;">Threat Planning</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-191"><span style="color: #000000;">Deconfliction Process</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-192"><span style="color: #000000;">Costs and Funding</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-193"><span style="color: #000000;">Rules of Engagement : </span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-193"><span style="color: #000000;">The rule of Engagement establishes the responsibility, relationship and guidelines between the Red Team, the customer and the system owner. This Rules of Engagement drives the whole process of execution. Rules of Engagement includes :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-194"><span style="color: #000000;">Authorised Actions</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-195"><span style="color: #000000;">Explicitly Restricted Actions</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-196"><span style="color: #000000;">Authorised Targets and Target Space</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-197"><span style="color: #000000;">Restricted Items</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-198"><span style="color: #000000;">Engagement Objectives</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-199"><span style="color: #000000;">The Red Team methodology defines the Rule of Engagement document, detailing the activities and execution process, along with specifying the hardware and software to employ. It also includes the deconfliction process, mentioning the available threats and their comparison. It must also include the identification and references to appropriate legal requirements, along with the legal responsibility disclaimer. Each Red Teamer must also document their tasks along with all the information about the target. This information of the target has organization name, address, specific groups or divisions, organizational identifiers, senior management contact info. </span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-200"><span style="color: #000000;">Pre-coordination is the base of successful engagement. To construct an effective plan, the Red Team must understand the target environment, all stakeholders, and any addition legal and contractual requirements of the target environment.</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-201"><span style="color: #000000;">Management Risk : </span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-201"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a process of identifying, accessing and controlling that risk that comes from the engagement factors. The main aim of managing risk is to remove unnecessary risks instead of eliminating all of them, while we implement efforts outlined in ROE without causing any irreversible damage to the target environment. It is the responsibility of Red Team to implement risk management and accepting all the risks at an initial stage. Risk Management is important to Red Team engagement as it helps to conserve resources, avoid unwarranted risk, making alternative decision when required and taking effective control measures. The Risk management process includes :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-202"><span style="color: #000000;">Identify potential issues</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-203"><span style="color: #000000;">Assess each risk to determine the direct impact to the target environment</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-204"><span style="color: #000000;">Develop controls designed to mitigate risks</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-205"><span style="color: #000000;">Make a risk decision</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-206"><span style="color: #000000;">Identify Residual risk</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-207"><span style="color: #000000;">Continually assess</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-208"><span style="color: #000000;">Risk Evaluation under Management Risk</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-209"><span style="color: #000000;">Evaluators often visualize the process by constructing a Risk Assessment Matrix. Analysts commonly use this matrix to estimate the degree of severity and probability for each potential vulnerability.</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-210"><span style="color: #000000;">Standard 3×3 Vulnerability Risk Matrix Example:</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-211"><span style="color: #000000;">Probability: The likeliness that an event will occur</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-212"><span style="color: #000000;">Low — Unlikely</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-213"><span style="color: #000000;">Medium — May result in</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-214"><span style="color: #000000;">High – Likely</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-215"><span style="color: #000000;">Impact: is the expected result of an event (degree of injury, property damage or other mission impairing factors) measure as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-216"><span style="color: #000000;">Low — Restricted Impact on Operations</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-217"><span style="color: #000000;">Medium — Measurable impact on Operations</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-218"><span style="color: #000000;">High — Important Impact on Operations</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-219"><span style="color: #000000;">Standard 5×4 Vulnerability Risk Matrix Example:</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-220"><span style="color: #000000;">Probability: The possibility of occurrence of an event</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-221"><span style="color: #000000;">Frequent – Occurs often</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-222"><span style="color: #000000;">Likely – Occurs several times in x period</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-223"><span style="color: #000000;">Occasional – Occurs sporadically</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-224"><span style="color: #000000;">Seldom – Unlikely, but could occur</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-225"><span style="color: #000000;">Unlikely – Probably will not occur</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-226"><span style="color: #000000;">Severity: is the expected result of an event (degree of injury, property damage or other mission impairing factors) measure as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-227"><span style="color: #000000;">Catastrophic Direct impact, Rustically long duration if not permanent</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-228"><span style="color: #000000;">Critical —Significant Impact, Stops or Halts operation</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-229"><span style="color: #000000;">Moderate — Noticeable loss, Reduces/Slows Operation/Production</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-230"><span style="color: #000000;">Marginal — Limited loss, noticed but does not halt operation</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-231"><span style="color: #000000;">Negligible — Some loss, Unnoticed if not monitored closely</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-232"><span style="color: #000000;">The above matrix construct identifies vulnerability as the key; however, Red Teaming does not focus on vulnerability. Given that thought process, the Red Team should construct an alternative risk matrix to determine the risk of potential threat actions.</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-233"><span style="color: #000000;">Threat Planning</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-234"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a major factor in Red Teaming engagement. In this stage following information is obtained from the customer and OSINT:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-235"><span style="color: #000000;">Threat Information (Landscape TTPs)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-236"><span style="color: #000000;">Threat to the Target Environment (OSINT)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-237"><span style="color: #000000;">Threat to the Target Environment (Customer Issues, Previous Grievances)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-238"><span style="color: #000000;">Real world example of threat</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-239"><span style="color: #000000;">Threat in Engagement condition</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-240"><span style="color: #000000;">Level of Threat</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-241"><span style="color: #000000;">Target Data</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-242"><span style="color: #000000;">The realism of threat must be taken under consideration by the Red Team. It is the job of Red Team to select attack types and strategies to simulate realistic threats even if the organization decide not to unleash the full capabilities of the threat. Defining threat-based attacks will provide a viable mechanism for training the target audience and strengthening the target environment. In order to outline the initial list of attacks the Red Team to carefully weigh the different options in regard to the engagement.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-243"><span style="color: #000000;">The end goal of threat planning is to portray the threat as real as possible in order to protect the organization from the real attack.</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-244"><span style="color: #000000;">De-confliction process</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-245"><span style="color: #000000;">De-confliction allows Red Team to clearly identify which activity is to be and not be generated by them. The said activity includes both network and physical activities. In this stage of engagement is to be able to distinguish between Red Team activity and real-world attack as quickly and as correctly as possible. deconfliction process includes :</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-246"><span style="color: #000000;">Ensuring trusted agents understand the actions and impacts of activities as they occur.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-247"><span style="color: #000000;">All OPLOGS are accurately and thoroughly completed.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-248"><span style="color: #000000;">Providing OPLOGS and activity list to the ECG as requested</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-249"><span style="color: #000000;">Exchanging periodic situation reports with the white cell.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-250"><span style="color: #000000;">When the De-confliction is requested, the Red Team lead has the duty to assess the information and isolate it from Red Team activity. This includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-251"><span style="color: #000000;">Halting all activities in the area of the incident</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-252"><span style="color: #000000;">Reviewing the ROE for limitations, objectives and dc-confliction instructions</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-253"><span style="color: #000000;">Reviewing OPLOGS to determine activities the Team was conducting at the time indicated</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-254"><span style="color: #000000;">Confirming or Denying Red Team activities for each deconfliction incident</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-255"><span style="color: #000000;">Confirm findings with the ECG, White Cell, and TA.</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-256"><span style="color: #000000;">Ensure findings are relayed by e-mail as well as by telephone</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-257"><span style="color: #000000;">Maintaining records of de-confliction information, actions, assessment and findings</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-258"><span style="color: #000000;">If assessment indicates the Red Team is the originator:</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-259"><span style="color: #000000;">Determine and isolate the specific activities and scripts employed</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-260"><span style="color: #000000;">Determine and isolate the specific logs supporting the timeframe of the incident</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-261"><span style="color: #000000;">Notify the Engagement Control Group</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-262"><span style="color: #000000;">The engagement planning process should include the estimate amount of time required to properly execute the De confliction process and when to use it.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-263"><span style="color: #000000;">Free play is an excellent concept to greatly enhance the results of A Red Team engagement. This concept allows the time to deviate from plan in order to explore for interesting operations. A Red Team lead can always provide guidance to freely explore as time allows them to.</span></p>
<h4 class="ai-optimize-264"><span style="color: #000000;">Engagement Execution</span></h4>
<p class="ai-optimize-265"><span style="color: #000000;">Halting an engagement simply means pausing current actions for a certain span of time. You should decide and plan the conditions where a pause is required. In the following conditions, a HALT is required:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-266"><span style="color: #000000;">Deconfliction request are received</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-267"><span style="color: #000000;">Real-world issues impact the target environment</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-268"><span style="color: #000000;">Key personnel suddenly become unavailable</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-269"><span style="color: #000000;">A SITREP (Situation Report) is generally performed by Red Team lead. It is to be maintained at all times. And it should contain the following information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-270"><span style="color: #000000;">Current location of operation (systems/networks for network Teams or buildings/offices for physical Teams)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-271"><span style="color: #000000;">Information pertinent to the objectives of the Team</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-272"><span style="color: #000000;">Information key to the success of engagement impacts</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-273"><span style="color: #000000;">Updates or modifications to the ROE</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-274"><span style="color: #000000;">Recent actions of each Team member</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-275"><span style="color: #000000;">Current action of each Team member</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-276"><span style="color: #000000;">Intended future actions of each Team member</span></li>

</ul>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-317"><span style="color: #800000;">How to End the Red Team Engagement?</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-318"><span style="color: #000000;">After the execution of engagement is done, it is very important to systematically end the Red Team Engagement. Some of the important things to remember when ending the Red Team engagement are reverting modifications, executive out brief and tech on tech sessions.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-319"><span style="color: #000000;">Once the Red Team finishes execution, a self-destruct code written as both time-based and target-based should automatically destroy all the tools, artefacts, exploits, and persistence mechanisms to prevent execution outside the engagement window or exploitation outside the target environment. The Red Team is responsible for removing all items that could be self-destroyed from the environment.</span></p>
<h5 class="ai-optimize-320"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In the event that target system security controls were disabled:</span></strong></h5>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-321"><span style="color: #000000;">Restore the controls as soon as possible</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-322"><span style="color: #000000;">Test the control to ensure restoration</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-323"><span style="color: #000000;">Notify the TA of any security control that does not effectively restore</span></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="ai-optimize-324"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In the event that target system modifications were made:</span></strong></h5>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-325"><span style="color: #000000;">Revert file system modifications</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-326"><span style="color: #000000;">Remove access mechanisms and/or backdoors</span></li>

</ul>
<h5 class="ai-optimize-329"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">For all restoration actions:</span></strong></h5>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-330"><span style="color: #000000;">Ensure file artefacts generated by the mechanism are removed</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-331"><span style="color: #000000;">Examine entire system to confirm the mechanism was not inadvertently copied or moved</span></li>

<li class="ai-optimize-340"><span style="color: #000000;">Repeat process for strays</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-341"><span style="color: #000000;">Provide a list of all artefacts, names, hashes, locations, and clean-up status to TA</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ai-optimize-342"><span style="color: #000000;">Executive out brief is a meeting dedicated towards impact of Red Team engagement on the organization and how to protect it. In this meeting, Red Team lead has to highlight critical observations made during the engagement along with additional information security or technical staff. The observation of ‘where the organization is vulnerable’ can also include legal staff and critical system information.</span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-343"><span style="color: #000000;">A tech on tech briefing can be extremely valuable to the organization as it provides bi-directional exchange of information between Red Team and blue Team. During this exchange, both the Red and defensive elements provide a highly detailed step-by-step technical review of the actions and results (including all associated detail) of the engagement.</span></p>
<h5 class="ai-optimize-344"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The role of Red Team during tech-on-tech:</span></strong></h5>

<li class="ai-optimize-350"><span style="color: #000000;">Provides recommendations or techniques that would limit each threat action</span></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="ai-optimize-351"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The role of Defensive Team tech-on-tech:</span></strong></h5>
<ul>
<li class="ai-optimize-352"><span style="color: #000000;">Has the opportunity to ask the how and why</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-353"><span style="color: #000000;">Explain the process for securing and defending their environment</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-354"><span style="color: #000000;">Identify any alerts, triggers, or anomalies within the environment during engagement</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-355"><span style="color: #000000;">Step through blue actions in response to Red Team activity (this occurs simultaneously to Red Team walk through)</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-356"><span style="color: #000000;">Identifies how Red Team activity could have been detected, prevented or leveraged</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-357"><span style="color: #000000;">Provides feedback to Red Team actions and recommendations</span></li>
<li class="ai-optimize-358"><span style="color: #000000;">Uses tech-on-tech information to perform post engagement analysis prior to receipt of official report</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="ai-optimize-359"><span style="color: #800000;">Report Writing</span></h3>
<p class="ai-optimize-360"><span style="color: #000000;">Reporting is a critical aspect of Red Team Engagement. Analysts can examine and use reports as a major form of evidence to provide a base for improving security. They are important as they confirm the existence of engagement. Reports not only document the activity that we conducted during a specific engagement but also provide an excellent reference that we can use to plan and design other engagements. Many engagements can share similar approaches and goals. Reports can provide a roadmap to design and plan future engagements. Reporting a Red Team engagement can be quite different than reports generated in penetration tests or vulnerability assessments. Red Team engagements are highly scenario focused. This leads to a report that is story driven. </span></p>
<p class="ai-optimize-360"><span style="color: #000000;">Penetration testing or vulnerability assessment reports focus on findings. security tests. Rather than discover that an out-of-date patch can cause successful exploitation of a workstation, a Red Team may use the exploit to deploy a command and control agent. This agent explores an organization and ultimately steals proprietary organizational data. The Red Team drives goals intended to stimulate or measure not only technical flaws but security operations as a whole. This includes people, processes, and technology. A Red Team report will use a story-based format where observations instead of findings are listed.</span></p>
<h5 class="ai-optimize-384"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Structure and Focus of a Red Team Report</span></strong></h5>
<p class="ai-optimize-361"><span style="color: #000000;">Report includes various perspectives such as attack narrative. The Attack Narrative section of the report contains the observations made during a Red Team engagement. Typically, they write these in a chronological format. The Red Team must document key observations they use to achieve goals. This includes any step Red Team takes to achieve a goal. Threat profiles or other lOCs that Blue can use during post analysis should be included. The end of a Red Team engagement is can be the beginning of post forensic analysis. Blue Teams who take advantage Red Team lOCs by performing post analysis can use this information to find blind spots or tune security tools to better protect against threats.</span></p>
